<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Singapore law practices that are registered under Order 63A of the Rules of Court shall file, serve, deliver or otherwise convey all documents to the Registrar in all proceedings using the Electronic Filing Service.</li>
      <li>Full Registration Foreign Lawyers granted full access to the Electronic Filing Service under paragraph 48(3) are to file, serve, deliver or otherwise convey all documents to the Registrar using the Electronic Filing Service.</li>
      <li>Full Registration Foreign Lawyers who are nominated by foreign law practices as authorised users under paragraph 47(2) are to file, serve, deliver or otherwise convey all documents to the Registrar using the Electronic Filing Service.</li>
      <li>Where it is impracticable for a Full Registration Foreign Lawyer to file, serve, deliver or otherwise convey documents to the Registrar using the Electronic Filing Service in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) above, a request for assistance to record such documents in the Electronic Filing Service may be made to the Registrar.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>(4A) Where the request for assistance under sub-paragraph (4) is made, the documents may be sent or made accessible to the Registrar:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ol>
          <li>by electronic mail;</li>
          <li>by personal delivery or courier to the SICC Registry of CD-ROM(s) or DVD-ROM(s) containing soft copies of the documents in Portable Document Format (PDF). Parties should note that the CD-ROM(s) or DVD-ROM(s) that is provided will be retained by the SICC Registry as part of the record of the case; or</li>
          <li>by uploading soft copies of the documents in Portable Document Format (PDF) in online folders designated by the SICC Registry for such purposes. Full Registration Foreign Lawyers are required to make prior arrangements with the SICC Registry for access to such online folders before this option may be utilised.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>The documents sent or made accessible by Full Registration Foreign Lawyers to the Registrar, under sub-paragraph (4A), will be recorded by the SICC Registry in the Court’s electronic case file using the Electronic Filing Service under sub-paragraph (4), only after the requisite filing fees are received by the SICC Registry. The Registrar may deduct such fees from the party’s deposit where the party has maintained a deposit with the SICC Registry.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>(5A) The SICC Registry will provide assistance under sub-paragraph (4) only during the operating hours of the SICC Registry, as provided in paragraph 7 of these Practice Directions.

<p>(5B) For the avoidance of doubt:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ol>
          <li>the act of sending or making accessible documents to the Registrar by the means set out in sub-paragraph (4A) does not constitute the filing or service of the documents. Such documents shall be deemed filed only when the documents are recorded by the SICC Registry in the Court’s electronic case file using the Electronic Filing Service. The SICC Registry will not assist in effecting service of documents. Parties are reminded that they must comply with any requirement to serve documents as provided in the Rules of Court or directed by the Court.</li>
          <li>the party requesting the assistance of the Registrar, under sub-paragraph (4), to record documents in the Court’s electronic case file using the Electronic Filing Service remains fully responsible for complying with any timeline or requirement that exists for the filing or service of such documents. The party should factor in time that will be required for processing such requests.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Parties are reminded not to transmit voluminous documents by electronic mail and should instead use the transmission methods set out at sub-paragraph (4)(b) or (4)(c) for such documents. In any event, parties must ensure that the size of each electronic mail sent to the SICC Registry does not exceed 20 MB.</li>
      <li>For the avoidance of doubt, section 13 of the Electronic Transactions Act (Cap. 88) shall apply for the determination of the time and place of despatch and receipt of documents sent or made accessible to the Registrar under sub-paragraph (4A).

        <ol>
          <li>the following electronic address <a href="mailto:Supcourt_SICCRegistry@supcourt.gov.sg">Supcourt_SICCRegistry@supcourt.gov.sg</a> in respect of documents sent by the means set out under sub-paragraph (4A)(a) above; and</li>
          <li>in respect of documents sent by the means set out under sub-paragraph (4A)(c), the electronic address shall be the uniform resource locater (URL) of the online folder that has been designated by the SICC Registry for such purpose.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Summonses that are filed using the Electronic Filing Service pursuant to sub-paragraph (1), (2) or (3) will be routed to the inbox of the applicant’s counsel’s Electronic Filing Service account after acceptance for filing by the Court.
