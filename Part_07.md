*   1.  The SICC Registry will make available via the Electronic Filing Service a statement of the deposit standing to the credit of each party. Notwithstanding Order 110, Rule 49(4) of the Rules of Court, each party shall be responsible for ensuring that it maintains the following minimum credits standing in its deposit:
        1.  For proceedings commenced by a writ of summons, each party shall maintain a credit of at least S$ 3,000;

Each party shall, on its own accord without demand, furnish such amounts as may be required to maintain its deposit at or above the stipulated amounts.

*   1.  From time to time, the SICC Registry may make a written request to a party requiring that it fortifies its deposit. A party thus notified shall ensure that it furnishes, within 14 calendar days of the date of the request, such additional amounts as may be required to ensure that its deposit is at or above the amount stipulated in the request.
    2.  In the event that the deposit falls below the amount stipulated in sub-paragraph (1) or where the deposit has not been fortified after the issuance of a written request pursuant to sub-paragraph (2), the Registrar may, pursuant to Order 110, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court, refuse to administer or continue administering proceedings in the Court or in an appeal from the Court with respect to the party in default. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the party that is not in default may take steps to advance its case against the defaulting party. Pursuant to Order 110, Rule 50 of the Rules of Court, any party may pay to the Registrar any unpaid fee or deposit, and upon the full payment of all fees and deposits, the Registrar must administer or continue to administer the proceedings.

    2.  Upon the occurrence of a prescribed event, the SICC Registry shall debit each party’s deposit by the prescribed amount and shall make available to each party via the Electronic Filing Service a written advice of the exact amount deducted from its deposit. For charges and fees other than those payments under a prescribed event, the SICC Registry shall make available to a party via the Electronic Filing Service written notice of the amount to be debited from its deposit and may effect such debit no less than 3 working days after the date of such written notice.
    3.  Where a party to the proceedings is not a subscriber to the Electronic Filing Service, the correspondence referred to in sub-paragraph (2) shall be furnished upon request to that party by e-mail sent to the party’s e-mail address indicated in the electronic case file.

## Statements of account

*   1.  The SICC Registry shall make available to each party with statements of such amounts standing to its credit in its deposit via the Electronic Filing Service.
    2.  Where a party to the proceedings is not a subscriber to the Electronic Filing Service, such statement shall be furnished upon request to the party by e-mail sent to the party’s e-mail address indicated in the electronic case file. Parties and counsel are therefore reminded to ensure that the administrative details contained in the electronic case file in the Electronic Filing Service are kept up-to-date. This may be done via the methods set out at paragraphs 20(2) and 20(3) of these Practice Directions.

## Refunds of deposits

*   1.  After the conclusion of each case, the SICC Registry shall render a final statement to each party of its deposit together with a Return of Deposit form. Upon receipt of such final statement, each party with a credit in its deposit shall select its preferred option for the return of its deposit and return the Return of Deposit Form to the SICC Registry.
    2.  After the expiry of the period of 30 calendar days from the date of receipt of the Return of Deposit Form the SICC Registry shall return such amounts standing to the credit of that party in the manner selected in the Return of Deposit Form, less any amounts that may be reasonably incurred by reason of the mode of payment selected.
    3.  Where:
        1.  within 30 calendar days from the date of the final statement, the Return of Deposit form referred to in sub-paragraph (1) is not returned; or
        2.  no option for the return of the party’s deposit is selected,

the SICC Registry shall determine the manner in which such amounts standing to the credit of that party is to be returned and shall return such amounts accordingly.

## Electronic payment of fees and charges

_Implementation of the electronic system for the payment of fees_

*   1.  Notwithstanding anything in these Practice Directions, all deposits, fees and charges not paid using the Electronic Filing Service must be paid by electronic means.

_Modes of electronic payment_

*   1.  Payment through electronic means includes payment effected by wire transfer (e.g. SWIFT), Interbank GIRO (IBG), NETS, Cashcards and selected credit cards.
    2.  Save that payments of fees for the purposes of becoming a Registered Foreign Lawyer or a Registered Law Expert may be made using selected credit cards through an online payment portal, payment through NETS, Cashcards and selected credit cards may only be effected at the Supreme Court cashier’s counter.
    3.  For Singapore law practices and law firms with a presence in Singapore, payment by IBG would be the most appropriate mode of electronic payment. A law firm using IBG will authorise the Supreme Court to deduct the fees from its bank account upon lodgement of the prescribed lodgement form. The law firm will receive detailed reports on its IBG payments to facilitate accounting and help with bank reconciliation.

_Scope of electronic payment_

*   1.  The electronic payment covers all fees, including court fees, hearing fees (whether the hearing is held in Court, by teleconference or video conference) and all other fees and charges for services or otherwise that may be payable to the Court in relation to proceedings in the Court.

_Registrar’s discretion_

*   1.  The Registrar may, in any case, waive the requirements for payment to be effected by electronic means, on such terms and conditions as he deems fit.
