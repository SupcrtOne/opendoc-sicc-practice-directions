  <main class="site-main" id="main-content" aria-label="Content"><h1 id="part-xix---trials-and-other-hearings">PART XIX - TRIALS AND OTHER HEARINGS</h1>

<h2 id="trial-in-public">Trial in public</h2>

<p>(1) All trials heard in the Court shall be in public unless a confidentiality order has been made.</p>

<p>(2) Any party may make an application to the Court for a confidentiality order.</p>

<h2 id="applicable-rules-of-evidence">Applicable rules of evidence</h2>

<p>Subject to any orders made by the Court under Order 110, Rule 23 of the Rules of Court on the applicable rules of evidence, this Part shall apply to all trials and other hearings heard in the Court.</p>

<h2 id="opening-statements">Opening Statements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>An opening statement is of great assistance to the Court as it sets out the case in a nutshell, both as to facts and law. It is intended to identify both for the parties and the Judge the issues that are, and are not, in dispute. It enables the Judge to appreciate what the case is about, and what he is to look out for when reading and listening to the evidence that will follow. The need for brevity is emphasised as opening statements that contain long and elaborate arguments, and citations from and references to numerous authorities, do not serve this purpose.
        <ol>
          <li>Opening statements will be required from all parties in all actions commenced by writ in the Court, except where dispensation has been granted by the Court.</li>
          <li>All opening statements must include the following:
            <ol>
              <li>the nature of the case generally and the background facts insofar as they are relevant to the matter before the Court and indicating which facts, if any, are agreed;</li>
              <li>the precise legal and factual issues involved are to be identified with cross-references as appropriate to the pleadings. These issues should be numbered and listed, and each point should be stated in no more than one or two sentences. The object here is to identify the issues in dispute and state each party’s position clearly, not to argue or elaborate on them;</li>
              <li>the principal authorities in support of each legal proposition should be listed, while the key documents and witnesses supporting each factual proposition should be identified;</li>
              <li>where there is a counterclaim or third party action, the opening statement must similarly address all issues raised therein; and</li>
              <li>an explanation of the reliefs claimed (if these are unusual or complicated).</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs or hearing days have been wasted by a poorly drafted opening statement, the Court may impose costs or other sanctions against the relevant person.</li>
          <li>The following format shall be adhered to when preparing opening statements:
            <ol>
              <li>all pages shall be paginated, with the first page (including the cover page) numbered as ‘Page 1’ so that the page numbers of the hard copy correspond to the page numbers in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version;</li>
              <li>the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent;</li>
              <li>the print of every page shall be double spaced;</li>
              <li>each page may be printed on one side or both sides; and</li>
              <li>every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35 mm in width.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>All opening statements should not exceed 20 pages (including all annexes and appendices, but excluding the cover page and backing page).</li>
          <li>Opening statements may be amended at trial, but counsel will be expected to explain the reasons for the amendments.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Subject to the Court’s directions, each party may supplement their opening statements with an oral address before the Court. These supplementary opening statements should be as brief as the circumstances allow and in any event, subject to the previously directed timetable at the Case Management Conference(s) or any other time limit as the Judge may allow.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="examination-and-cross-examination-of-witnesses">Examination and Cross-Examination of Witnesses</h2>

<p><em>General</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The examination, cross-examination, and re-examination of all witnesses shall be subject to the time limits set out in any previously directed timetable at the Case Management Conference or at the Pre-trial Review, or any other time limit as the trial Judge may allow. Counsel are expected to stay within those time limits.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Witnesses of fact</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Where a witness of fact has already deposed to an affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the examination of that witness should be confined to confirming the truth of that affidavit, correcting or clarifying any typographical or clerical errors in that affidavit, and where the Court has granted leave in accordance with paragraph 111(3) of these Practice Directions, clarifying or supplementing his evidence with oral testimony.</li>
      <li>Upon completion of evidence-in-chief, the witness will then be cross-examined. Where a witness is cross-examined by more than one party, the Court shall determine the order in which the other parties cross-examine the witnesses. Counsel are expected to comply with the rules of evidence found in Singapore law, whether under the Evidence Act (Cap. 97) or elsewhere, or other applicable evidential rules if any rule of evidence found in Singapore law has been disapplied pursuant to an order under Order 110, Rule 23 of the Rules of Court. Counsel are also expected to comply with all relevant ethical codes in the conduct of the cross-examination.</li>
      <li>Unless expressly allowed by the Court, once the witness commences cross-examination, the witness shall not be permitted to discuss his evidence with anyone, including any counsel, until that witness is released from his oath after re-examination.</li>
      <li>Upon completion of cross-examination(s), the witness shall be re-examined by the party who called the witness.</li>
      <li>The Court may, at any time, ask the witness questions. Where the questions elicit answers which parties have not previously dealt with, the Court shall allow parties a reasonable opportunity to direct questions to that witness on the answers given.</li>
      <li>The Court may, where appropriate, direct that cross-examination and re-examination be conducted on an issue by issue basis. The witness will be cross-examined and re-examined on the first issue, then cross-examined and re-examined on the second issue, and so on.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="use-of-presentation-slides-for-trial-and-other-hearings-other-than-proceedings-before-the-court-of-appeal">Use of presentation slides for trial and other hearings (other than proceedings before the Court of Appeal)</h2>

<p>Subject to approval by the Court, parties may utilise presentation slides to assist in the conduct of trial and other hearings (other than proceedings before the Court of Appeal). Presentation slides may be projected in the courtroom or Chambers at the appropriate time (e.g. during oral submissions, in the course of examination of witnesses etc.). Presentation slides shall comply with the following standards:</p>

<p><em>Typeface</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>A clear typeface such as Arial or Times New Roman should be used; care should be taken to ensure that the font used is of at least a size equivalent to Arial font size 32. Bold and italicised fonts should be used sparingly.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Colours</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>There should be sufficient contrast between the slide background and text: it is preferable to use black or dark fonts with a light background. The colours used in slide backgrounds should be muted and preferably monochromatic.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Animation and sounds</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Animation of slides or elements within a slide should be avoided. Similarly, sounds should not be incorporated in the presentation slides unless they are necessary.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Corporate logos</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Corporate logos of the law practice may be displayed on the presentation slides. Care should be taken to ensure that the size and location of corporate logos do not distract from the substance of the presentation slides.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="closing-submissions">Closing Submissions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Unless otherwise directed, the Court will require written closing submissions from the parties.</li>
      <li>Written closing submissions will, unless the Court deems otherwise appropriate, be by way of an exchange of submissions, and unless otherwise directed, followed by reply submissions responding and confined to points raised in the other party’s initial closing submissions.</li>
      <li>After the written closing submissions have been filed and exchanged, the parties will be allowed to make oral submissions if so directed by the Court. The Court may impose time limits on the length of time each party is given for oral submission.</li>
    </ol>

    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Strict adherence to the timelines for filing Trial Bundles</em></p>

    <ol>
      <li>Parties are to note that the timeline in Order 34, Rule 3A of the Rules of Court (i.e. no less than 5 working days before the trial) is to be adhered to strictly. If an adjournment of the trial is necessitated by the failure to comply with the timeline for filing the trial bundle, the Court may impose costs or other sanctions against the party in default.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Bundles of documents</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The bundle of documents required to be filed by Order 34, Rule 3A of the Rules of Court should be paginated consecutively throughout the top right hand corner and may be printed on one side or both sides of each page.
        <ol>
          <li>An index of contents of each bundle in the manner and form set out in Form 17 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions must also be furnished. No bundle of documents is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on any document at the trial.</li>
          <li>Under Order 34, Rule 3A(3) of the Rules of Court, it is the responsibility of counsel for all parties to agree and prepare an agreed bundle of documents as soon as possible. The scope to which the agreement extends must be stated in the index sheet of the agreed bundle.</li>

            <ol>
              <li>be firmly secured together with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding. The rings or spinets should be red for plaintiffs and blue for defendants with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back;</li>
              <li>have flags to mark out documents to which repeated references will be made in the course of hearing. Such flags shall bear the appropriate indicium by which the document is indicated in the index of documents so that, as far as possible, they do not overlap one another; and</li>

          </li>
          <li>Where originals and copies of documents are included in one bundle, it should be stated in the index which documents are originals and which are copies.</li>
          <li>Only documents which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included in the bundles. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary documents, the Court may impose costs or other sanctions against the relevant person.</li>
          <li>A core bundle should also be provided, unless one is clearly unnecessary. The core bundle should contain the most important documents upon which the case will turn or to which repeated reference will have to be made. The documents in this bundle should not only be paginated but should also be cross-referenced to copies of the documents included in the main bundles. The bundle supplied to the Court should be contained in a loose-leaf file which can easily have further documents added to it if required.</li>

<h2 id="bundles-of-authorities">Bundles of authorities</h2>

<p><em>General requirements</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>

        <ol>
          <li>The bundle of authorities shall contain all the authorities, cases, statutes, subsidiary legislation and any other materials relied on.</li>
          <li>The bundle of authorities shall be arranged in the following order – statutes in alphabetical order of the title, subsidiary legislation in alphabetical order of the title, cases in alphabetical order of the case name, secondary materials (such as textbooks and articles) in alphabetical order of the last name of the author, and any other materials in alphabetical order of the title or last name of the author as is appropriate.</li>
          <li>The bundle of authorities shall be paginated consecutively at the top right hand corner of each page. Pagination should commence on the first page of the first bundle and run sequentially to the last page of the last bundle.</li>
          <li>The bundle of authorities shall have a table of contents immediately after the title page. Where the bundle of authorities consists of more than one volume, each volume shall have a table of contents clearly indicating the authorities that are contained in that volume.</li>
          <li>The items in the table of contents shall be numbered sequentially, and bound in the order in which they are listed.</li>
          <li>The table of contents shall contain a concise statement of the relevance of each authority to the specific issues before the Court. The relevance of each authority shall be succinctly expressed and comprise no more than 3 sentences. The statement shall be set out immediately after the name of the case. For example:</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Cartier International BV v Lee Hock Lee and another application</em> [1992] 3 SLR 340</p>

<p>Relevance: Where the Court is asked to punish an alleged contemnor by incarceration, the charge against him must be proved to the high standard required in a criminal charge.</p>

<p><em>Rickshaw Investments Ltd &amp; Anor v Nicolai Baron von Uexkull</em> [2008] 1 SLR(R) 377</p>

<p>Relevance: Choice of law considerations are relevant even when determining the natural forum to hear a dispute.</p>

  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ol>
          <li>Only authorities which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included in the bundles. No bundle of authorities is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on any authority at the trial.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Where hard copies of the bundle of authorities are prepared, they shall:
        <ol>
          <li>be properly bound with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding. The rings and spines should be red for plaintiffs and blue for defendants with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back;</li>
          <li>have flags to mark out the authorities. Such flags shall bear the appropriate indicium by which the authority is referred to. Flags shall be spaced out evenly along the right side of the bundle so that as far as possible they do not overlap one another; and</li>
          <li>may be printed on one side or both sides of each page.</li>
          <li>be legible. Clear legible photocopies of original authorities may be exhibited instead of the originals provided the originals may be made available for inspection (if required) by the other parties before the hearing and by the Judge at the hearing.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The Court may reject bundles of authorities that are not in compliance with the general requirements in this paragraph, and in exercising its discretion as to costs, take such non-compliance into account.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="citation-of-judgments">Citation of judgments</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyers or Registered Law Experts who wish to cite a judgment as authority in support of their oral or written submissions shall adhere to the following directions.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Use of judgments as authorities in submissions</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyers or Registered Law Experts who cite a judgment must state the proposition of law that the judgment establishes and the parts of the judgment that support that proposition. Such statements should not excessively add to the length of the submissions but should be sufficient to demonstrate the relevance of that judgment to the argument made. Where the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyers or Registered Law Experts wish to cite more than two judgments as authority for a given proposition, there must be a compelling reason to do so, and this reason must be provided by the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyers or Registered Law Experts in the submissions.</li>
      <li>The Court will also pay particular attention to any indication in the cited judgment that the judgment (i) only applied decided law to the facts of the particular case; or (ii) did not extend or add to the existing law.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Citation practice</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyers or Registered Law Experts should, where possible, make specific citations by referring to the paragraph number of the judgment, and not to the page number of the judgment or report. For consistency, square brackets ([xx]) should be used to denote paragraph numbers.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Ancillary provisions</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs may, where appropriate in the circumstances, take into account the extent to which counsel, a Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or a Registered Law Expert has complied with this paragraph in the citation of judgments before the Court.</li>
      <li>It will remain the duty of counsel, a Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or a Registered Law Expert to draw the attention of the Court to any judgment not cited by an opponent, which is adverse to the case being advanced.</li>
      <li>This paragraph applies to all hearings in the Court, both open Court and Chambers.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
