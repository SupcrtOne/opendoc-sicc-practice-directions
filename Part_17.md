# PART XVII - INTERLOCUTORY APPLICATIONS (INCLUDING APPLICATIONS FOR INJUNCTIONS)

## Interlocutory applications

_Inter partes interlocutory applications_

*   1.  An _inter partes_ interlocutory application should be filed as a summons. Any supporting affidavit(s) should be filed together with the application. The application should be filed, served, delivered or otherwise conveyed to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 44, 45 or 46 of these Practice Directions. The applicant may, at the time of filing the application, indicate a preferred hearing date.
    2.  The application will be endorsed with a summons number and hearing date, and thereafter be returned to the applicant by the SICC Registry. Where no hearing date has been indicated on the endorsed summons, the SICC Registry will inform parties of the hearing date subsequently. Generally, the hearing date will not be less than two weeks after the date of issuance of the summons.
    3.  Parties are reminded to serve the application and all supporting affidavits as soon possible after the endorsed application is returned by the SICC Registry to the applicant.
    4.  In the event that the hearing date referred to at sub-paragraph (2) is not suitable, parties may make a request for a different or preferred hearing date in accordance with paragraph 102 of these Practice Directions.

_Ex parte interlocutory applications_

*   1.  In all cases where a party approaches the Court on an _ex parte_ basis, that party must consider its duty to make full and frank disclosure to the Court and the potential consequences of material non-disclosure. Parties should also bear in mind their continuing duty to make full and frank disclosure of all disclosable matters that arise or occur to the party after the grant of _ex parte_ relief.
    2.  An _ex parte_ interlocutory application should be filed as a summons. When an _ex parte_ interlocutory application is filed, the affidavit(s) in support of the application should be filed together with the _ex parte_ summons. The application should be filed, delivered or otherwise conveyed to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 44, 45 or 46 of these Practice Directions. The applicant may, at the time of filing, indicate a preferred hearing date.

## Hearing of interlocutory applications

*   1.  All interlocutory applications in matters before the Court will be heard in Chambers by a Judge unless otherwise directed by the Court.
    2.  As far as possible, the SICC Registry will assign all interlocutory applications in matters before the Court to the Judge who will be hearing the trial or other dispositive hearing of the matter.

## Hearing of “_ex parte_” and “by consent” summonses

*   1.  Ordinary summonses which are endorsed:
        1.  “ex parte” must bear a certificate to that effect signed by the applicant’s counsel;
        2.  “by consent” must bear a certificate to that effect signed by all counsel concerned.
    2.  Any other summons not endorsed as described in sub-paragraph (1) will be regarded as a contentious matter.
    3.  After the filing of any “_ex parte_” or “by consent” summons, the application will be considered by a Judge. If the Judge is satisfied that the application is in order and all other requirements have been complied with, he may, in accordance with Order 110, Rule 51 of the Rules of Court, dispose of the application on the day fixed for the hearing of the application without the attendance of the parties or their counsel.

## _Ex parte_ applications for injunctions and search orders

*   1.  Order 29, Rule 1 of the Rules of Court provides that an application for the grant of an injunction may be made _ex parte_ in cases of urgency. Nevertheless, a respondent to an _ex parte_ application, especially where the application seeks injunctive relief, should be invited to attend at the hearing of the application.
    2.  In view of this, any party applying _ex parte_ for an injunction (including a _Mareva_ injunction) must give notice of the application to the other concerned parties prior to the hearing. The notice may be given by way of email, facsimile transmission or telex, or, in cases of extreme urgency, orally by telephone. Except  in cases of extreme urgency or with the leave of the Court, the party shall give a minimum of two hours’ notice to the other parties before the hearing. The notice should inform the other parties of the date, time and place fixed for the hearing of the application and the nature of the relief sought. If possible, a copy of the originating process, the _ex parte_ summons and supporting affidavit(s) should be given to each of the other parties in draft form as soon as they are ready to be filed in Court.
    3.  At the hearing of the _ex parte_ application, in the event that some or all of the other parties are not present or represented, the applicant’s counsel should inform the Court of:
        1.  the attempts that were made to notify the other parties or their counsel of the making of the application;
        2.  what documents were given to the other parties or their counsel and when these documents were given; and
        3.  whether the other parties or their counsel consent to the application being heard without their presence.
    4.  The directions set out in sub-paragraph (2) need not be followed if the giving of the notice to the other parties, or some of them, would or might defeat the purpose of the _ex parte_ application.
    5.  All _ex parte_ applications for injunctions and search orders must be supported by an affidavit containing the following information under clearly defined headings:
        1.  Reason(s) the application is taken out on an ex parte basis, including whether the applicant believes that there is a risk of dissipation of assets, destruction of evidence or any other prejudicial conduct;
        2.  Urgency of the application (if applicable), including whether there is any particular event that may trigger the dissipation of assets, destruction of evidence or any other prejudicial conduct;
        3.  Factual basis for the application, including the basis of any belief that there will be dissipation of assets, destruction of evidence or any other prejudicial conduct, whether there have been any past incidents of the opponent dissipating assets, destroying evidence or engaging in any other prejudicial conduct, and whether there is any evidence of dishonesty or bad faith of the opponent;
        4.  Factual basis for any reasonable defences that may be relied on by the opponent;
        5.  Whether the applicant is aware of any issues relating to jurisdiction, _forum non conveniens_ or service out of jurisdiction, and if so, whether any application relating to these issues has been or will be made;
        6.  An undertaking to pay for losses that may be caused to the opponent or other persons by the granting of the orders sought, stating what assets are available to meet that undertaking and to whom the assets belong; and
        7.  Any other material facts which the Court should be aware of.
    6.  An applicant must prepare skeletal submissions on the points to be raised at the hearing of the _ex parte_ application. At the hearing, the applicant shall give a copy of the skeletal submissions to the Court and to any opponent present. As soon as possible after the hearing, the applicant shall file the skeletal submissions in Court.
    7.  The Court may also require the applicant to prepare a note of the hearing setting out the salient points and arguments canvassed before the Court and may order such a note to be served together with the court documents on any opponent who is not present at the hearing or within a reasonable time after the service of the court documents.

## _Mareva_ injunctions and search orders

*   1.  Applicants for _Mareva_ injunctions and search orders are required to prepare their orders in accordance with the following forms in Appendix B of these Practice Directions:
        1.  Form 13: Search order;
        2.  Form 14: Worldwide _Mareva_ injunction; and
        3.  Form 15: _Mareva_ injunction limited to assets within the jurisdiction.
    2.  The language and layout of the forms are intended to make it easier for persons served with these orders to understand what they mean. These forms of orders should be used save to the extent that the Judge hearing the application considers there is a good reason for adopting a different form. Any departure from the terms of the prescribed forms should be justified by the applicant in his supporting affidavit(s).
    3.  The applicant should undertake not to inform any third party of the proceedings until after the return date.
    4.  Where practicable, applications should be made sufficiently early so as to ensure that the Judge has sufficient time to read and consider the application in advance.
    5.  On an _ex parte_ application for either a _Mareva_ injunction or search order, an applicant may be required, in an appropriate case, to support his cross-undertaking in damages by payment to be made into Court, a bond to be issued by an insurance company with a place of business within Singapore, a written guarantee to be issued from a bank with a place of business within Singapore or any other mode which the Court deems fit.

## Execution of a search order

*   1.  The attention of counsel is drawn to _Universal Thermosensors Ltd v Hibben_ \[1992\] 1 WLR 840 at 861 where it was suggested that a search order be served by a supervising solicitor and carried out in his presence and under his supervision:
        1.  The supervising solicitor should be an experienced solicitor who is not a member or employee of the firm acting for the applicant and who has some familiarity with the operation of search orders. The evidence in support of the application should include the identity and experience of the proposed supervising solicitor.
        2.  Where the premises are likely to be occupied by an unaccompanied woman, at least one of the persons attending on the service of the order should be a woman.
        3.  Where the nature of the items removed under the order makes this appropriate, the applicant will be required to insure them.
    2.  In this regard, the supervising solicitor should be an Advocate and Solicitor.
