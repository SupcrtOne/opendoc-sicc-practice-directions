# Part XIV - REQUESTS FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS

**Physical Documents**

## Production of physical documents

*   1.  The Court may order the production of documents under Order 110, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court if the requirements stated in Order 110, Rule 15(3) are satisfied and none of the objections stated in Order 110, Rule 17(2) applies.
    2.  In particular, the documents sought to be produced must be relevant and material to the case. It is not sufficient that the documents may lead to a train of inquiry resulting in the obtaining of information which may adversely affect or support a party’s case.

**Electronic Documents**

## Production of electronic documents

*   1.  Paragraphs 92 to 96 of these Practice Directions provide a framework for proportionate and economical requests for the production of electronic copies of electronically stored documents. This Part or any portion thereof applies:
        1.  by mutual agreement of all parties in the cause or matter; or
        2.  when the Court so orders, either on its own motion or on application by a party.

A party that seeks to rely on this Part must cite the relevant paragraph(s) in any request or application made hereunder.

*   1.  Parties are encouraged to collaborate in good faith and agree on issues relating to production of electronically stored documents within the scheme for production of documents set forth in Order 110, Rules 14 to 21 of the Rules of Court.
    2.  Parties should consider the application of this Part or any portion thereof in the following cases:
        1.  where the claim or the counterclaim exceeds S$ 1 million;
        2.  where documents that may be produced by a party exceeds 2,000 pages in aggregate; or
        3.  where documents that may be produced in the case or matter comprise substantially of electronic mail and/or electronic documents.
    3.  For the avoidance of doubt, this Part applies to pre-action production of documents, production of documents between parties in a pending cause or matter, and production of documents by third parties.

_Location of electronically stored documents_

*   1.  Electronically stored documents may reside in storage management systems, folders or directories in storage locations, electronic media or recording devices, including folders or directories where temporarily deleted files are located (for example, the Recycle Bin folder or Trash folder). Electronically stored documents or parts thereof may also reside in the unallocated file space or file slack on an electronic medium or recording device as deleted files or file fragments which may be recovered through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques.

_Meaning of “metadata information”_

*   1.  Metadata information refers to the non-visible and not readily apparent information embedded in or associated with electronically stored documents and may include both application metadata, which is created by the application software used to create the electronic documents, and system metadata, which is created by the operating or storage system. Examples of application metadata include hidden columns or text, formatting and display codes, formulae, prior edits and editorial comments; examples of system metadata include data relating to creation, modification and access of the electronic document, its size, file format and storage location, and other document profile information like title, author, subject and keywords or tags. Metadata information may be stored internally within the electronically stored document or externally in a separate file or database. Externally stored metadata information shall be produced as separate documents.

_Meaning of “not reasonably accessible documents”_

*   1.  Electronically stored documents which are not reasonably accessible include:
        1.  deleted files or file fragments containing information which may be recovered only through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques; and
        2.  documents archived using backup software and stored off-line on backup tapes or other storage media.

_Meaning of “forensic inspection”_

*   1.  A forensic inspection of an electronic medium or recording device means a reasonable search of the electronic medium or recording device for the purpose of recovering deleted electronic documents, which may extend to a forensic examination of the unallocated file space or file slack of the electronic medium or recording device using computer forensic tools and/or techniques.

## Production of metadata information

*   1.  Internally stored metadata information shall be produced as part of the electronically stored document in which it is embedded. Externally stored metadata information shall be produced separately from the electronically stored documents or class of electronically stored documents that it is associated with. Unless a request for production specifies that production of externally stored metadata information of the requested electronically stored documents is required, the party providing production of documents shall not be required to produce externally stored metadata information.
    2.  An application for production of externally stored metadata information of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents must be supported by an affidavit showing that a request for such externally stored metadata information had been made previously.

## Reasonable searches for electronically stored documents

*   1.  A class of electronically stored documents may be described by specifying or describing a search term or phrase to be used in a search for electronically stored documents which shall be sufficiently particularised (“reasonable search”). A request for production by describing a class of electronically stored documents with reference to search terms or phrases is deemed to be sufficiently particularised if it specifies or describes limits on the scope of the search; such limits shall include at least the following:
        1.  specifying or describing custodians and repositories, for example, physical or logical storage locations, media or devices; and
        2.  specifying the period during which the requested electronically stored documents were created, received or modified.
    2.  Subject to paragraph 95 of these Practice Directions, requests for reasonable searches shall not extend to electronically stored documents which are not reasonably accessible unless the conditions in this paragraph are met. A party requesting a reasonable search for electronically stored documents which are not reasonably accessible must demonstrate that the relevance and materiality of the electronically stored documents justify the cost and burden of retrieving and producing them.
    3.  The obligations of a party responding to a request for reasonable search for electronically stored documents is fulfilled upon that party carrying out the search to the extent stated in the request and producing any electronically stored documents located as a result of that search. The party producing documents shall not be required to review the search results for relevance.

_Applications to Court_

*   1.  An application for production of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which specifies or describes a search term or phrase to be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents must specify or describe limits on the scope of the search to be conducted.
    2.  An application for production of any electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which specifies or describes a search term or phrase to be used in a reasonable search for electronically stored documents which are _not reasonably accessible_ must:
        1.  specify or describe limits on the scope of the search to be conducted; and
        2.  be supported by an affidavit demonstrating that the relevance and materiality of the electronically stored documents sought to be produced justify the cost and burden of retrieving and producing them.

_Review for the purpose of asserting privilege_

*   1.  Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the party producing documents from reviewing the responsive electronically stored documents or the results of any reasonable search for the purpose of identifying privileged documents. However, such review for the purpose of identifying privileged documents shall not extend to the intentional deletion, removal or alternative or metadata information. Review for the purpose of asserting privilege must, unless otherwise agreed by parties or ordered by the Court, be concluded within 14 calendar days after the search results are made available to the party producing documents.

## Matters to which regard shall be had in determining whether production is necessary

*   1.  In determining an application under Order 110, Rule 17 of the Rules of Court, where it is for the production of electronic documents, the Court shall, in addition to the matters set out in Order 110, Rule 17(2)(b) of the Rules of Court, have regard to the following matters:
        1.  the number of electronic documents involved;
        2.  the nature of the case and complexity of the issues;
        3.  the value of the claim and the financial positions of the parties;
        4.  the ease and expense or retrieval of any particular electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents, including –
            1.  The accessibility, location and likelihood of locating any relevant and material documents,
            2.  the costs of recovering and producing any relevant and material documents,
            3.  the likelihood that any relevant and material documents will be materially altered in the course of recovery, or the production; and
        5.  The significance of any particular electronically stored document or class of electronically stored documents which are likely to be located to the issues in dispute.

## Production of electronic copies

*   1.  A person required to produce electronically stored documents shall generally produce an electronic copy in the native format in which the requested electronic documents are ordinarily maintained and in one or more read-only optical disc(s).
    2.  Metadata information internally stored in the native format of the responsive electronically stored documents shall not be intentionally deleted, removed or altered without the agreement of the parties or an order of Court. Where the party required to produce electronically stored documents objects to production for inspection of certain responsive electronically stored documents solely on the ground that the internally stored metadata information is protected by privilege, but does not object to the production of the electronic documents without the internally stored metadata information, copies of such documents may be supplied in a reasonably usable format with all or such of the metadata information over which privilege is claimed removed.

_Requests for the supply of copies_

*   1.  A request for copies of responsive electronically stored documents may specify the format and manner in which such copies are to be supplied. If the party producing documents does not agree with the specified format or manner or both, he may either:
        1.  propose a reasonably usable format and/or storage medium and/or a reasonable manner in which he intends to supply copies of the requested electronic documents; or
        2.  in default of agreement, supply copies of the requested documents in accordance with sub-paragraph (1).
    2.  The party required to produce electronically stored documents shall not be required to supply copies of responsive electronic documents in more than one format.
    3.  The file formats set out in Appendix E of these Practice Directions shall be deemed to be reasonably usable formats for the purpose of this paragraph.

_Applications for the supply of copies_

*   1.  Applications for the supply of copies of responsive electronically stored documents shall specify the format and manner in which copies of such electronic documents are to be supplied.
