# PART XVIII - EVIDENCE FOR TRIAL

## Foreign law

*   1.  The Court may, pursuant to Order 110, Rule 25 of the Rules of Court and upon an application of a party, order that any question of foreign law arising in any cause or matter in the Court be determined on the basis of submissions instead of proof.
    2.  In making the order referred to in sub-paragraph (1), the Court must be satisfied that each party is or will be represented by counsel, a Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or a Registered Law Expert who is suitable and competent to submit on the relevant questions of foreign law. For this purpose, the Court may require that party to provide evidence attesting to the suitability of the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or Registered Law Expert (including evidence of good standing).
    3.  Where the order referred to in sub-paragraph (1) is made, and a foreign lawyer or law expert wishes to make submissions on the relevant questions of foreign law on behalf of any party, the foreign lawyer or law expert may do so provided that:
        1.  the foreign lawyer or law expert is registered under sections 36P or 36PA of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161); and
        2.  the foreign lawyer or law expert is named in the said order as being authorised to make submissions on the relevant question of foreign law.
    4.  In assessing competence for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2), the Court may consider:
        1.  The experience of the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or Registered Law Expert in practising the foreign law or subject matter in question;
        2.  The qualifications of the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or Registered Law Expert in relation to the foreign law or the subject matter in question; and
        3.  The proficiency of the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or Registered Law Expert in the language in which the foreign law in question is in.
    5.  In assessing the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or Registered Law Expert for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2), the Court may take into account its own competence in the foreign law or subject matter in question and proficiency in the language in which the foreign law in question is in.

## Witnesses of Fact

*   1.  All affidavits of evidence-in-chief shall be in English. Where a witness is not fluent in English or does not understand English, and intends to rely on or refer to a translation of his affidavit at trial, the translated affidavit should be provided to the counsel for the other party at the time that affidavits of evidence-in-chief are exchanged.
    2.  An affidavit of evidence-in-chief should, as far as possible, be in the witnesses’ own words and should not contain legal or other arguments. It should identify which statements are made from the deponent’s own knowledge and which statements are based on information or belief, and if the latter, should identify the source or basis for the statement of information or belief.
    3.  A witness giving oral evidence at trial may, with the permission of the Court and subject to any directions or limitations the Court may impose, be allowed to orally supplement his evidence in response to matters arising after the filing of affidavits of evidence-in-chief or in response to assertions by the other party or parties which the witness has not had a reasonable opportunity to respond to.

_Release of witness upon completion of evidence_

*   1.  Every witness will be released from his oath by the Court upon completion of his evidence. If counsel does not wish for the witness to be released, it is his duty to apply to the Court and inform the Court of the reason for this application.

    4.  At the top right hand corner of the first page of every affidavit, the following information shall be typed or printed in a single line:
        1.  The party on whose behalf the affidavit is filed;
        2.  The name of the deponent;
        3.  The ordinal number of the affidavit in relation to the previous affidavits filed in the cause or matter by the deponent;

*   1.  Every page of the affidavit (including separators and exhibits) shall be paginated consecutively, and the page number shall be inserted at the centre top of the page. The page number of the printed copy of the affidavit must coincide with the page number of the electronic copy of the affidavit.

    3.  Hard copies of affidavits may be printed on one side or both sides of each page.

## Non-documentary exhibits to affidavits

*   1.  Non-documentary exhibits (e.g. tapes, samples of merchandise, etc.) shall be clearly marked with the exhibit mark in such a manner that there is no likelihood of the exhibit being separated or misplaced. The affidavit should indicate that the exhibit (e.g. tapes, samples of merchandise, etc.) is a non-documentary exhibit and refer to it according to the relevant exhibit number.
    2.  Where the exhibit consists of more than one item (e.g. CD-ROMs in a box) each and every such separate item of the exhibits shall similarly be separately marked with enough of the usual exhibit marks to ensure precise identification.
    3.  Where it is impracticable to mark on the article itself, such article or the container thereof shall be tagged or labelled with the exhibit mark securely attached to the exhibit in such a manner that it is not easily removable.
    4.  Very small non-documentary exhibits shall be enclosed or mounted in a sealed transparent container and tagged or labelled as aforesaid. An enlarged photograph showing the relevant characteristics of such exhibits shall, where applicable, be exhibited in the affidavit.

## Documentary exhibits to affidavits

Every page of the exhibits, including cover pages, dividing sheets or separators between exhibits, shall be consecutively numbered at the top right hand corner of each page, following from the page numbers of the affidavit (i.e. the first page of the exhibits shall take the number following the last page of the affidavit’s main text). Where applicable, the page number of the affidavit must correspond to the page number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version that is filed through the Electronic Filing Service.

_Dividing sheets_

*   1.  The exhibits in an affidavit shall be prefaced by a dividing sheet, marked, typed or stamped clearly with an exhibit mark as follows:

“This is the exhibit marked \[letter of the alphabet or a number\] referred to in the affidavit of \[name of the deponent\] and sworn/affirmed before me this \[date on which the affidavit is sworn or affirmed\].

Before me,

SGD

A Commissioner for Oaths / A Notary Public”

_Bookmarks_

*   1.  Each exhibit in the affidavit must be separately bookmarked in the Portable Document Format (PDF) document that is filed. The names of the bookmarks should follow the initials of the deponent of the affidavit, for example, “JT-1”, “JT-2”.

_Numbering_

*   1.  Where a deponent deposes to more than one affidavit with exhibits in the same action, the numbering of the exhibits in all subsequent affidavits shall run consecutively throughout, and not begin again with each affidavit. For instance, where a deponent in his first affidavit has marked two exhibits as “JT-1” and “JT-2”, the first exhibit in his second affidavit should be marked as “JT-3” instead of “JT-1”.

_References to exhibits in other affidavits_

*   1.  Where a deponent wishes to refer to documents already exhibited to another deponent’s affidavit, he shall be required to exhibit them in his own affidavit.

_Related documents_

*   1.  Related documents (e.g. correspondence and invoices) may be collected together and collectively exhibited as one exhibit arranged in chronological order, beginning with the earliest at the top, paginated in accordance with sub-paragraph (3) above, and the exhibit must have a front page showing the table of contents of the items in the exhibit.

If, on an application for directions under Order 25, Rule 3 or Order 27, Rule 1 of the Rules of Court, or pursuant to Case Management Conference(s), orders are made prescribing the time within which objection to the contents of affidavits of evidence-in-chief must be taken, the objections must be taken in accordance with the directions contained in this paragraph and not otherwise.
