# Part XIII - EXPERT WITNESSES

## Appointment of expert witnesses

*   1.  In cases where expert witnesses will be called to give evidence at the trial, counsel for each party intending to call an expert witness or expert witnesses shall write to all other parties in accordance with the timelines directed by the Judge (at a Case Management Conference or otherwise) to:
        1.  inform the other parties of the name(s) of the expert(s) which that party intends to engage;
        2.  set out the areas or issues which the expert(s) will be providing testimony; and
        3.  attach the curriculum vitae of the expert(s).
    2.  Counsel for each party is to inform all other parties in accordance with the timelines directed by the Judge on whether there are any objections to the experts that will be called by the other parties.
    3.  Counsel may raise objections about the experts at or prior to a Case Management Conference, and seek directions from the Judge at the Case Management Conference. If objections are raised prior to a Case Management Conference, such objections should be in writing and sent to all other parties.

## Preparation for witness conferencing for expert witnesses

*   1.  The Court will, as a default practice, direct that the experts meet before trial to discuss their respective reports, to determine where they are in agreement on the issues, and, where they do not agree, the extent of their disagreement. The parties and their lawyers will not be permitted to attend these expert meetings unless otherwise directed by the Court. The experts will thereafter be expected to prepare a joint experts’ report setting out:
        1.  a list of issues and/or technical issues;
        2.  areas/issues where they are agreed;
        3.  areas/issues where they disagree;
        4.  the reasons, nature and extent of their disagreement; and
        5.  any other information which may assist the Court.
    2.  If the experts reach an agreement on an issue or issues, the parties shall not be bound by it unless the parties expressly agree to be bound by it. However, the Court will be entitled to take cognizance of the experts’ agreement.
    3.  Accordingly, as far as possible, and in accordance with the timelines directed by the Judge (at a Case Management Conference or otherwise), parties should agree on a timetable for:
        1.  the experts’ meeting; and
        2.  the preparation of a joint experts’ report.
    4.  Counsel for each party is to seek consensus with counsel for all other parties on the issue of use of concurrent evidence procedure (see paragraph 90 of these Practice Directions) for experts pursuant to Order 40A, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court, and to update the Court at a Case Management Conference or by correspondence, as may be directed by the Court.

## Expert evidence at trial

*   1.  The provisions of Order 40A of the Rules of Court shall apply to all aspects of expert evidence.
    2.  Generally, at the trial, expert witnesses will give evidence after all the witnesses of fact have been heard. This issue will usually be discussed at the Case Management Conference(s).
    3.  Expert witnesses may be examined concurrently as a panel (see paragraph 90 of these Practice Directions). This issue will usually be discussed at the Case Management Conference(s).
    4.  Sub-paragraphs (2) and (3) above are subject to the parties waiving their right or rights to submit no case to answer. For the avoidance of doubt, if the parties do not agree to waive their right or rights to submit no case to answer, there will not be concurrent examination of the expert witnesses as a panel.

## Concurrent evidence procedure

*   1.  The Court may direct that the evidence of several experts be taken concurrently. Where the taking of concurrent evidence is contemplated, experts may be directed to agree on a list of issues and the order in which expert evidence on those issues are to be given. For this purpose, an experts’ meeting may be directed for experts to:
        1.  discuss without the presence of counsel (unless such presence is otherwise directed by the Court); and
        2.  agree on the list of issues and the order in which expert evidence on those issues are to be given.
    2.  Where concurrent expert evidence is directed, the manner in which concurrent expert evidence is to be taken is at the Court’s discretion. Parties should note that in general, a full cross-examination or re-examination is neither necessary nor appropriate.
