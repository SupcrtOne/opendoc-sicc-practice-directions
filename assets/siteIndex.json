(2) The directions set out in sub-paragraphs (3) to (9) below are to be followed in relation to all requests for the interpretation services of interpreters from the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section, whether the services are required for hearings in open Court or in Chambers. (3) Not less than 7 working days before the day on which the services of an interpreter are required (“scheduled day”), the requesting party must file a Request addressed to the appropriate Head Interpreter from the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. The Request must be accompanied by Form 2A of Appendix B of these Practice Directions, in Portable Document Format (PDF). (4) The request in sub-paragraph (3) must also be filed for hearings of matters which have been adjourned or part-heard, even if the services of an interpreter were requested and provided at an earlier hearing of the same matter. In the event that a Request is made in respect of an adjourned or part-heard matter, the Request should state the date of the earlier hearing. (5) The requesting party shall make payment of any prescribed fees for interpretation services under the Rules of Court upon approval of the Request. The Registrar may deduct such fees from the party’s deposit where the party has maintained a deposit with the SICC Registry. (6) In the event that the services of the interpreter are for any reason not required on any of the scheduled days specified in the Request, the requesting party shall immediately notify the appropriate Head Interpreter either by letter or email. This shall serve as a notice of cancellation. (7) Any request for refund of the fee paid under sub-paragraph (5) must be submitted in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions within one month after the date on which the reason for the refund arose. The supporting reasons and the amount of refund sought must be clearly indicated in the request for refund. (8) Unless otherwise decided by the Registrar, the fee paid for any scheduled day may be refunded only if a notice of cancellation under sub-paragraph (6) is given at least 1 clear working day prior to that scheduled day. (9) The provision of interpretation services by the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section is subject to the availability of suitable interpreters on the day that the interpretation services are required. Failure to comply with the directions set out in sub-paragraphs (3) to (5) may result in the services of interpreters not being available or provided. (10) Engagement of private interpreters (i.e. interpreters not from the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section): (a) For the avoidance of doubt, a party may engage the services of a private interpreter for interpretation services in respect of the languages listed in Appendix C of these Practice Directions. (b) If a party requires the services of an interpreter in a language apart from those listed in Appendix C to these Practice Directions, it shall be the duty of the party to engage such an interpreter directly to obtain his or her services for the scheduled hearing. (c) Interpreters who are not from the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section must be sworn in before the Duty Registrar before they may provide interpretation services for proceedings in the Court. (11) Requests for translation of documents in Chinese, Malay or Tamil for use in proceedings in the Court should be submitted using the form available on the SICC website at least 4 weeks before the date the translations are required, unless there are exceptional reasons justifying non-compliance.

(a) Where a party to a case is a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service, that party may access the online case file through the Electronic Filing System directly and may inspect, download soft copies or print hard copies of documents accessible to the parties in the online case file. (b) Where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service, or is unable to access the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service for any reason, he may either: (i) submit a request in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions; or (ii) attend at the Service Bureau to seek assistance; to inspect or download copies of documents accessible to the parties in the online case file, or for hard copies of such documents to be provided. Printing charges may be chargeable by the Court or the Service Bureau for reproducing documents in paper form. (2) All parties to a case shall have the liberty to make amendments at will to administrative details contained in the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service. Administrative details include the contact details of counsel, the identities of counsel, and the nature of the claim. Where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service or is unable to access the case file through the Electronic Filing Service, he may attend at the Service Bureau to seek assistance to amend the administrative details contained in the electronic case file. (3) The SICC Registry may require parties to a case to provide supporting documents to substantiate proposed amendments to other details of the electronic case file before the amendment is allowed to be effected. For example, amendments to add or remove a party to the case have to be supported by an order of court; and amendments to change the name, gender, identification number, or marital status of a party to the case have to be substantiated by documentary proof. File inspection and obtaining copies of documents by non-parties (4) In order to inspect a case file, the following procedure should be followed: (a) A request Formerly known as “praecipe” must be made to obtain leave to inspect the file. The request shall be in Form 3 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions and filed in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. The request shall state the following: (i) the name of the person who is to carry out the search or inspection. If this person is not a counsel representing the non-party, his identity card or passport number should also be included in the request after his name, and a copy of his identity card or passport should be provided; (ii) the interest that the applicant has in the matter; and (iii) the reason for the search or inspection. If the search or inspection is requested for the purpose of ascertaining information for use in a separate suit or matter, the request should clearly state the nature of the information sought and the relevance of such information to the separate suit or matter. (b) Once approval for inspection has been received from the Court: (i) registered users can inspect the case file online through the Electronic Filing Service; (ii) parties who are not registered users can inspect the case file by presenting a copy of the approval at the Service Bureau. (c) After verifying the approval, the Service Bureau will assign the inspecting party a personal computer for the inspection to be carried out. (d) An inspecting party will usually be allowed 60 minutes to carry out the inspection. If a longer period is required, the Service Bureau may impose a charge for use of the computer. The Service Bureau may impose additional charges for downloading soft copies or printing hard copies of documents from the case file being inspected. (5) A case file which has been sealed, whether under Order 110, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court or otherwise, shall not be inspected by a non-party to those proceedings unless leave of Court is obtained pursuant to Order 110, Rule 30(10) and (11) of the Rules of Court. (6) Counsel must communicate to the Registrar in writing the names of persons authorised by them to make searches and inspections. Such authority may be in respect of a specific search or inspection or for a specified period. (7) For the avoidance of doubt, a non-party who has obtained approval to inspect a case file may take and retain a soft copy of any document that is available for inspection. All copies of documents taken in the course of inspection should not be used for purposes other than those stated in the request to inspect unless leave is obtained from the Court. Counsel shall be responsible for informing their clients of this. Obtaining certified true copies of documents (8) Applications to obtain certified true paper copies of documents should be made by way of filing a request in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. (a) The intended use of the certified true copies should be clearly stated in the request. The relevance and necessity of the certified true copies in relation to their intended use should also be clearly described. (b) Once approval is received from the Court, the applicant should present a copy of the approved request at the SICC Registry. (c) After verifying that the request has been approved, the SICC Registry will inform the applicant of any additional fees payable. Upon payment of the applicable fees, the SICC Registry will furnish the documents to the applicant. (d) The fees prescribed in Appendix BA to the Rules of Court will be payable for the above services in addition to further printing charges which may be chargeable by the Service Bureau for reproducing the copies in paper form. (9) All certified true copies obtained pursuant to the applications referred to at sub-paragraph (8) should not be used for purposes other than those stated in the applications unless leave is obtained from the Court.

Illustrations of when the “subject-matter of the dispute” is regulated by or otherwise subject to Singapore law The illustrations set out in this sub-paragraph are intended to demonstrate, as a matter of general principle, cases where the subject-matter of the dispute is regulated by or otherwise subject to Singapore law for the purposes of Order 110, Rule 1(2)(f)(i) of the Rules of Court. Such cases would, consequently, fall outside the scope of offshore cases: where there is a dispute over the sale of shares in a Singapore incorporated company pursuant to a share purchase agreement governed by New York law, the subject-matter of the dispute (i.e. the shares) is regulated by or otherwise subject to Singapore law; where there is a dispute over the transfer of land in Singapore pursuant to a contract governed by English law, the subject-matter of the dispute (i.e. the land) is regulated by or otherwise subject to Singapore law; and where there is a dispute over the affairs of a company pursuant to a shareholders’ agreement governed by Indonesian law and one of the issues relates to the use of a patent registered in Singapore, the subject-matter of the dispute (i.e. the patent) is regulated by or otherwise subject to Singapore law. “Substantial connection to Singapore” For the purposes of Order 110, Rule 1(2)(f)(ii) of the Rules of Court, the existence of each of the following factors will not, by itself, constitute a substantial connection between the dispute and Singapore: any of the witnesses in the case may be found in Singapore; any of the documents that are relevant to the dispute may be located in Singapore; funds connected with the dispute have passed through Singapore or are located in bank accounts in Singapore; one of the parties to the dispute has properties or assets in Singapore that are not the subject matter of the dispute; where one of the parties is a Singapore party, or where a party is not a Singapore party, but has Singapore shareholders. “Action in rem” For the purposes of the definition of an “offshore case” under Order 110, Rule 1(1) of the Rules of Court, an action in rem (against a ship or any other property) under the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap. 123) shall not be considered an offshore case. “Proceedings under the International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A)” (5) For the purposes of the definition of an “offshore case” under Order 110, Rule 1(1) of the Rules of Court, any proceedings under the International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A) that are commenced by way of any originating process shall not be considered an offshore case."

For Singapore law practices and law firms with a presence in Singapore, payment by IBG would be the most appropriate mode of electronic payment. A law firm using IBG will authorise the Supreme Court to deduct the fees from its bank account upon lodgement of the prescribed lodgement form. The law firm will receive detailed reports on its IBG payments to facilitate accounting and help with bank reconciliation. Scope of electronic payment The electronic payment covers all fees, including court fees, hearing fees (whether the hearing is held in Court, by teleconference or video conference) and all other fees and charges for services or otherwise that may be payable to the Court in relation to proceedings in the Court.

Such documents shall be deemed filed only when the documents are recorded by the SICC Registry in the Court’s electronic case file using the Electronic Filing Service. The SICC Registry will not assist in effecting service of documents. Parties are reminded that they must comply with any requirement to serve documents as provided in the Rules of Court or directed by the Court. the party requesting the assistance of the Registrar, under sub-paragraph (4), to record documents in the Court’s electronic case file using the Electronic Filing Service remains fully responsible for complying with any timeline or requirement that exists for the filing or service of such documents. The party should factor in time that will be required for processing such requests. Parties are reminded not to transmit voluminous documents by electronic mail and should instead use the transmission methods set out at sub-paragraph (4)(b) or (4)(c) for such documents. In any event, parties must ensure that the size of each electronic mail sent to the SICC Registry does not exceed 20 MB. For the avoidance of doubt, section 13 of the Electronic Transactions Act (Cap. 88) shall apply for the determination of the time and place of despatch and receipt of documents sent or made accessible to the Registrar under sub-paragraph (4A). For the purpose of section 13(2) of the Electronic Transactions Act (Cap. 88), the Registrar hereby designates: the following electronic address Supcourt_SICCRegistry@supcourt.gov.sg in respect of documents sent by the means set out under sub-paragraph (4A)(a) above; and in respect of documents sent by the means set out under sub-paragraph (4A)(c), the electronic address shall be the uniform resource locater (URL) of the online folder that has been designated by the SICC Registry for such purpose. Summonses that are filed using the Electronic Filing Service pursuant to sub-paragraph (1), (2) or (3) will be routed to the inbox of the applicant’s counsel’s Electronic Filing Service account after acceptance for filing by the Court.

"text": "Identification numbers to be stated in cause papers Parties named in the title of the documents Where a party to any proceedings in the Court first files a document in such proceedings, he shall state his identification number (in brackets) in the title of the document immediately after his name. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number in the title of the documents. Parties not named in the title of the documents Where a party to any proceedings in the Court first files a document in such proceedings, and the name of the party does not appear in the title of the document but does appear in the body of the document, then the identification number of the party should be stated (in brackets) after the first appearance of his name in the document. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number (in brackets) after the first appearance of the party’s name. Documents filed by 2 or more parties Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply, mutatis mutandis, to documents which are filed by more than one party. Identification numbers for non-parties If any person (living or dead), any entity or any property is the subject matter of any proceedings, or is affected by any proceedings, but is not a party thereto, and the name of such person, entity or property is to appear in the title of the documents filed in the proceedings, the party filing the first document in the proceedings must state the identification number of such person, entity or property (in brackets) immediately after the name of the same. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number (in brackets) immediately after the name of the person, entity or property to which it applies. If the party filing the first document in the proceedings is unable, after reasonable enquiry, to discover the identification number of the person, entity or property, he may state immediately after the name of the same “(ID No. not known)”. All documents subsequently filed by any party shall then contain these words (in brackets) after the name of this person, entity or property. Special cases The following directions shall apply in addition to the directions contained in sub-paragraphs (1) to (4): Where a party is represented by a litigation representation (formerly known as “next friend”) or guardian in adoption (formerly known as “guardian ad litem”), sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) shall apply to the litigation representation or guardian in adoption as if he was a party to the proceedings, and the identification numbers of the party, the litigation representation and/or guardian in adoption must be stated after their names; Where parties are involved in any proceedings as the personal representatives of the estate of a deceased person, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) shall apply to the deceased person as if he were a party; and Where more than one identification number applies to any party, person, entity or property, the identification numbers shall be stated in any convenient order. Identification numbers When entering the identification number in the Electronic Filing Service, the full identification number, including the letters before and after the number should be entered. Descriptive text which is required to be entered into the actual document, such as “Japanese Identification Card No.”, should not be entered into the electronic form. Guidelines for the selection of identification numbers The following guidelines should be followed in deciding on the appropriate identification number: Natural person with Singapore identity card: For a natural person who is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, the identification number shall be the number of the identity card issued under the National Registration Act (Cap. 201). The 7-digit number as well as the letters at the front and end should be stated. For example, “(NRIC No. S1234567A)”. Natural person with Foreign Identification Number (FIN): For a natural person (whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not) who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act, but has been assigned a FIN under the Immigration Regulations (Cap. 133, Regulation 1), the identification number shall be the FIN. The number should be preceded by the prefix “FIN No.”. Natural person – birth certificate or passport number: For a natural person (whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not) who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act (Cap. 201) or assigned a FIN under the Immigration Regulations (Cap. 133, Regulation 1), the identification number shall be the birth certificate or passport number. The number should be preceded by either of the following, as appropriate: “(Issuing country) BC No.” or “(Issuing country) PP No.”. Natural person – other numbers: For a natural person who is not a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, and has not been assigned a FIN under the Immigration Regulations (Cap. 133, Regulation 1) and does not have a birth certificate or passport number, the identification number shall be the number of any identification document he may possess. Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority issuing the identification document to be ascertained should be stated. For example, “Japanese Identification Card No.”. Deceased person: For a deceased natural person, the identification number shall be as set out in sub-paragraph (7)(a) to (7)(d) above. However, if such numbers are not available, the identification number shall be the death registration number under the Registration of Births and Deaths Rules (Cap.267, Rule 1) or the equivalent foreign provisions, where the death is registered abroad. The number as well as the following words should be stated: “(Country or place of registration of death) Death Reg. No.”. Company registered under the Companies Act: For a company registered under the Companies Act (Cap. 50), the identification number shall be the Unique Entity Number (UEN). Company registered outside Singapore: For a company registered outside Singapore which is not registered under the Companies Act (Cap. 50), the identification number shall be the registration number of the company in the country of registration. Business registered under the Business Registration Act: For a body registered under the Business Registration Act (Cap. 32), the identification number shall be the UEN number. Limitation Liability Partnership registered under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act: For a limited liability partnership registered under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2005 (Cap. 163A), the identification number shall be the UEN number. Other bodies and associations: For any other body or association, whether incorporated or otherwise, which does not fall within sub-paragraph (7)(f) to (7)(i) above, the identification number shall be any unique number assigned to the body or association by any authority. Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority assigning the number to be ascertained should be stated. For example, “Singapore Trade Union Reg. No. 123 A”. Ship or vessel: For a ship or vessel, the identification number shall be the registration number assigned by the port of registry. If no such registration number is available, the identification number assigned by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) or the number of the licence granted by any authority shall be the identification number. No identification numbers exist: Where the appropriate identification numbers prescribed by sub-paragraphs (7)(a) to (7)(k) above do not exist, the following words should be stated immediately below or after the name of the party, person, entity or property concerned: “(No ID No. exists)”. Inability to furnish identification number at the time of filing a document If a party who wishes to file a document is unable at the time of filing to furnish the necessary identification numbers required by this paragraph, the party may indicate “(ID Not Known)” at the time of filing. However, when the necessary identification numbers have been obtained, the party will have to furnish the necessary identification numbers to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. Meaning of document For the avoidance of doubt, the words “document” and “documents” when used in this paragraph include all originating processes filed in the Court. Non-compliance Any document which does not comply with this paragraph may be rejected for filing by the SICC Registry."

Endorsements are normally made on originating processes and other documents to show renewal, amendments and authorisation for service of the document in question. Such endorsements on originating processes and other documents do not require the Registrar’s signature as they are made pursuant to either an order of Court or the Rules of Court. The Registrar should therefore not be asked to sign such endorsements. For documents that are filed through the Electronic Filing Service as electronic forms composed online: Counsel should select the appropriate endorsement, and check the accuracy of the electronic form in the preview stage before filing the originating process or other document. The acceptance by the SICC Registry of electronic forms composed online does not affect the regularity or otherwise of any endorsements on the document. Where endorsements can be made prior to the filing or issuance of a document, those endorsements shall be incorporated into the document before the document is filed or issued. Where endorsements must be made on a document which has already been filed or issued, a fresh copy of the document containing the relevant endorsements shall be prepared, and the document must be re-filed or re-issued, as the case may be.

"text": "Amendment of documents The directions in this paragraph shall apply to documents and pleadings filed in any proceedings in the Court. Amendment of any document Where a document is required to be amended and filed in Court, a fresh copy of the document with the amendments included must be prepared, regardless of the number and length of the amendments sought to be made. The procedure for amending a document is as follows: a fresh amended copy of the document should be produced. the number of times the document has been amended shall be indicated in parentheses after the name of the document. It should therefore be entitled “[document name] (Amendment No. 1)” or “[document name] (Amendment No. 2)” as appropriate. the changes made in the document from the latest version of the document filed in Court should be indicated in the following way: deletions shall be made by drawing a single line across the words to be deleted; and insertions shall be underlined. The directions in sub-paragraph (3)(b) shall not apply to originating summonses and summonses amended from an inter partes application to an ex parte application or vice versa. The directions in sub-paragraph (3)(c) shall not apply to the originating processes, summonses and other electronic forms that are composed online through the Electronic Filing Service. Where the amendments are so numerous or of such a nature or length that to make written alterations of the document would make it difficult or inconvenient to read, the amended document should comprise two versions: a clean version without the amendments shown; followed in the same document by a version showing the amendments in colour. Where the document being amended is a writ, the amended writ must be reissued. A writ, pleading or other documents which has been amended must be endorsed with a statement that it has been amended, specifying the date on which it was amended and by whom the Order (if any) authorising the amendment was made and the date thereof, or, if no such order was made, the particular Rule in Order 20 of the Rules of Court pursuant to which the amendment was made. Amendment of pleadings The directions in sub-paragraphs (2), (3) and (7) shall apply to the amendment of pleadings. A Statement of Claim which is amended for the first time should be filed as “Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1)” and a Defence that is amended for the second time should be filed as “Defence (Amendment No. 2)”. Colour schemes for amendments The following colours shall be used to indicate the history of the amendments in the pleadings: black for the first round of amendments; red for the second round of amendments; green for the third round of amendments; blue for the fourth round of amendments; and brown for subsequent rounds of amendments. Amendments for third time or more From the third round of amendments onwards, the amended pleading should comprise two versions of the document: a clean version without the amendments shown; followed in the same document by a version showing the amendments in colour. Only one amended pleading consisting of these two versions is required to be filed. Amendment endorsements on electronic forms Order 20, Rule 10(2) of the Rules of Court requires that an amended pleading or other document be endorsed with a statement that it has been amended, specifying the date on which it was amended and by whom the order (if any) authorising the amendment was made and the date thereof, and if no such order was made, the number of the Rule in Order 20 pursuant to which the amendment was made. Where electronic forms are amended, the amendment endorsement shall take either one of the following forms: by order of court made on [date order was made]; or pursuant to Order 20, Rule [cite specific rule number]. The amendment endorsement shall be appended to the title of the electronic form, after the amendment number as required under sub-paragraph (3)(b) above. Where an electronic form is amended more than once, the endorsement need only cite the basis for the most recent amendment. For example, “Originating Summons (Amendment No 3, by order of court made on 1 January 2013)” “Writ of Summons (Amendment No 1, pursuant to O 20, r 3)” The date of the electronic form shall reflect the date on which the document is amended."

The provisions of Order 10 and Order 62 of the Rules of Court in relation to personal service of documents shall apply in this regard. The attention of counsel is drawn to Order 62, Rule 2(1) of the Rules of Court which provides: “Personal service must be effected by a process server of the Supreme Court or by a solicitor or a solicitor’s clerk whose name and particulars have been notified to the Registrar for this purpose: Provided that the Registrar may, in a particular cause or matter, allow personal service to be effected by any other named person and shall, in that case, cause to be marked on the document required to be served personally, a memorandum to that effect.” [Emphasis added.] Counsel are required to notify the SICC Registry of the particulars of such clerks who have been authorised by them to serve processes and documents (“authorised process servers”) by submitting a request to authorise user in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. Counsel’s clerks do not require the authorisation of the Registrar to effect personal service of processes and documents. As personal service can be effected by counsel or counsel’s clerks, Court process servers will not be assigned to effect personal service of processes and documents unless there are special reasons. If there are special reasons requiring personal service by a Court process server, a request for such service should be submitted to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions, setting out the special reasons. The approval of the Duty Registrar should then be obtained for such service. Once approval has been obtained, a process server will be assigned to effect service and an appointment for service convenient to both the litigant and the assigned process server will be given. On the appointed date, the person accompanying the Court process server should call at the SICC Registry. The amount required for the transport charges of the Court process server (a record of which will be kept) should be tendered. Alternatively, the SICC Registry should be informed beforehand that transport for the Court process server will be provided. The SICC Registry will then instruct the Court process server to effect service. Under no circumstances should any payment be made directly to the Court process server."

In all other circumstances, leave for service out of jurisdiction should be obtained under Order 11 or Order 69A, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court.

An application for an order for substituted service shall be made in the manner set out in Order 62, Rule 5(2) of the Rules of Court. The Court shall, on any such application, have the discretion to authorise the service of documents in such manner as the Court is satisfied will probably be effectual in bringing such documents to the notice of the person to be served. In any application for substituted service, the applicant should persuade the Court that the proposed mode of substituted service will probably be effectual in bringing the document in question to the notice of the person to be served. Two reasonable attempts at personal service should be made before an application for an order for substituted service is filed. In an application for substituted service, the applicant shall demonstrate by way of affidavit why he believes that the attempts at service made were reasonable. The applicant should, where appropriate, also consider other modes of substituted service, such as AR registered post or electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet transmission) in addition to or in substitution of substituted service by posting on doors or gates of residential and business premises. An application for substituted service by posting at an address or by AR registered post should contain evidence (for example, relevant search results from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, the Singapore Land Authority, the Housing &amp; Development Board or the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority) that the person to be served is resident or can be located at the property. For the avoidance of doubt, substituted service by AR registered post is deemed to be effected when the postal service has delivered the document, or attempted to deliver the document (in cases where no one is present or willing to accept the document). If substituted service is by electronic mail, it has to be shown that the electronic mail account to which the document will be sent belongs to the person to be served and that it is currently active. An application for substituted service by advertisement should only be considered as a last resort and should contain evidence that the person to be served is literate in the language of the newspaper in which the advertisement will be placed. The Court shall, in the exercise of its discretion referred to in sub-paragraph (2) above, give directions as to the manner in which the mode of service is to be effected, including (without limitation): 1. The content of any notice that must accompany the document to be served, explaining the nature of the document to be served, the steps that the Recipient must take upon receipt of the document and the possible consequences should the Recipient not take any action; and 2. The filing of an affidavit of service by the party effecting service of the document confirming that the directions of the Court have been adhered to."

Where parties are agreeable to mediation or any other form of ADR, the Judge may give directions for the subsequent conduct of the case, including the following: timelines for parties to contact the Singapore International Mediation Centre or any preferred mediation or ADR service provider; timelines for parties to conduct mediation or any other form of ADR; timelines for parties to update the court on the outcome of mediation or any other form of ADR; extensions of time for outstanding matters or a stay of proceedings pending the completion of mediation or any other form of ADR; timelines for outstanding matters that can continue in parallel; fixing of hearing dates for subsequent Case Management Conferences; and other consequential directions. Where parties are not willing to attempt mediation or any other form of ADR, the Judge may direct that the issue of mediation or any other form of ADR be reconsidered at the next Case Management Conference or at a specified stage in the proceedings. If parties reach a settlement agreement through mediation or any other form of ADR, a consent order may be recorded on the terms of the settlement if the Judge considers that it is appropriate to record the terms of settlement as a consent order. With the consent of all parties, the Court may direct that one or more of the protocols set out at Appendix F of these Practice Directions, as amended by such order or direction as the Court may make, be adopted in the proceedings. These protocols relate to: (a) the memorialisation of proceedings; and (b) the exchange of the affidavits of evidence-in-chief prior to discovery and/or the production of documents."

This Part or any portion thereof applies: by mutual agreement of all parties in the cause or matter; or when the Court so orders, either on its own motion or on application by a party. A party that seeks to rely on this Part must cite the relevant paragraph(s) in any request or application made hereunder. Parties are encouraged to collaborate in good faith and agree on issues relating to production of electronically stored documents within the scheme for production of documents set forth in Order 110, Rules 14 to 21 of the Rules of Court. Parties should consider the application of this Part or any portion thereof in the following cases: where the claim or the counterclaim exceeds S$ 1 million; where documents that may be produced by a party exceeds 2,000 pages in aggregate; or where documents that may be produced in the case or matter comprise substantially of electronic mail and/or electronic documents. For the avoidance of doubt, this Part applies to pre-action production of documents, production of documents between parties in a pending cause or matter, and production of documents by third parties. Location of electronically stored documents Electronically stored documents may reside in storage management systems, folders or directories in storage locations, electronic media or recording devices, including folders or directories where temporarily deleted files are located (for example, the Recycle Bin folder or Trash folder). Electronically stored documents or parts thereof may also reside in the unallocated file space or file slack on an electronic medium or recording device as deleted files or file fragments which may be recovered through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques. Meaning of “metadata information” Metadata information refers to the non-visible and not readily apparent information embedded in or associated with electronically stored documents and may include both application metadata, which is created by the application software used to create the electronic documents, and system metadata, which is created by the operating or storage system. Examples of application metadata include hidden columns or text, formatting and display codes, formulae, prior edits and editorial comments; examples of system metadata include data relating to creation, modification and access of the electronic document, its size, file format and storage location, and other document profile information like title, author, subject and keywords or tags. Metadata information may be stored internally within the electronically stored document or externally in a separate file or database. Externally stored metadata information shall be produced as separate documents. Meaning of “not reasonably accessible documents” Electronically stored documents which are not reasonably accessible include: deleted files or file fragments containing information which may be recovered only through the use of computer forensic tools or techniques; and documents archived using backup software and stored off-line on backup tapes or other storage media. Meaning of “forensic inspection” A forensic inspection of an electronic medium or recording device means a reasonable search of the electronic medium or recording device for the purpose of recovering deleted electronic documents, which may extend to a forensic examination of the unallocated file space or file slack of the electronic medium or recording device using computer forensic tools and/or techniques."

Nevertheless, a respondent to an ex parte application, especially where the application seeks injunctive relief, should be invited to attend at the hearing of the application. In view of this, any party applying ex parte for an injunction (including a Mareva injunction) must give notice of the application to the other concerned parties prior to the hearing. The notice may be given by way of email, facsimile transmission or telex, or, in cases of extreme urgency, orally by telephone. Except  in cases of extreme urgency or with the leave of the Court, the party shall give a minimum of two hours’ notice to the other parties before the hearing. The notice should inform the other parties of the date, time and place fixed for the hearing of the application and the nature of the relief sought. If possible, a copy of the originating process, the ex parte summons and supporting affidavit(s) should be given to each of the other parties in draft form as soon as they are ready to be filed in Court. At the hearing of the ex parte application, in the event that some or all of the other parties are not present or represented, the applicant’s counsel should inform the Court of: the attempts that were made to notify the other parties or their counsel of the making of the application; what documents were given to the other parties or their counsel and when these documents were given; and whether the other parties or their counsel consent to the application being heard without their presence. The directions set out in sub-paragraph (2) need not be followed if the giving of the notice to the other parties, or some of them, would or might defeat the purpose of the ex parte application. All ex parte applications for injunctions and search orders must be supported by an affidavit containing the following information under clearly defined headings: Reason(s) the application is taken out on an ex parte basis, including whether the applicant believes that there is a risk of dissipation of assets, destruction of evidence or any other prejudicial conduct; Urgency of the application (if applicable), including whether there is any particular event that may trigger the dissipation of assets, destruction of evidence or any other prejudicial conduct; Factual basis for the application, including the basis of any belief that there will be dissipation of assets, destruction of evidence or any other prejudicial conduct, whether there have been any past incidents of the opponent dissipating assets, destroying evidence or engaging in any other prejudicial conduct, and whether there is any evidence of dishonesty or bad faith of the opponent; Factual basis for any reasonable defences that may be relied on by the opponent; Whether the applicant is aware of any issues relating to jurisdiction, forum non conveniens or service out of jurisdiction, and if so, whether any application relating to these issues has been or will be made; An undertaking to pay for losses that may be caused to the opponent or other persons by the granting of the orders sought, stating what assets are available to meet that undertaking and to whom the assets belong; and Any other material facts which the Court should be aware of. An applicant must prepare skeletal submissions on the points to be raised at the hearing of the ex parte application. At the hearing, the applicant shall give a copy of the skeletal submissions to the Court and to any opponent present. As soon as possible after the hearing, the applicant shall file the skeletal submissions in Court. The Court may also require the applicant to prepare a note of the hearing setting out the salient points and arguments canvassed before the Court and may order such a note to be served together with the court documents on any opponent who is not present at the hearing or within a reasonable time after the service of the court documents."

All opening statements must include the following: the nature of the case generally and the background facts insofar as they are relevant to the matter before the Court and indicating which facts, if any, are agreed; the precise legal and factual issues involved are to be identified with cross-references as appropriate to the pleadings. These issues should be numbered and listed, and each point should be stated in no more than one or two sentences. The object here is to identify the issues in dispute and state each party’s position clearly, not to argue or elaborate on them; the principal authorities in support of each legal proposition should be listed, while the key documents and witnesses supporting each factual proposition should be identified; where there is a counterclaim or third party action, the opening statement must similarly address all issues raised therein; and an explanation of the reliefs claimed (if these are unusual or complicated). In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs or hearing days have been wasted by a poorly drafted opening statement, the Court may impose costs or other sanctions against the relevant person. The following format shall be adhered to when preparing opening statements: all pages shall be paginated, with the first page (including the cover page) numbered as ‘Page 1’ so that the page numbers of the hard copy correspond to the page numbers in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version; the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent; the print of every page shall be double spaced; each page may be printed on one side or both sides; and every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35 mm in width. All opening statements should not exceed 20 pages (including all annexes and appendices, but excluding the cover page and backing page). Opening statements may be amended at trial, but counsel will be expected to explain the reasons for the amendments. Subject to the Court’s directions, each party may supplement their opening statements with an oral address before the Court. These supplementary opening statements should be as brief as the circumstances allow and in any event, subject to the previously directed timetable at the Case Management Conference(s) or any other time limit as the Judge may allow."

Counsel are expected to stay within those time limits. Witnesses of fact Where a witness of fact has already deposed to an affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the examination of that witness should be confined to confirming the truth of that affidavit, correcting or clarifying any typographical or clerical errors in that affidavit, and where the Court has granted leave in accordance with paragraph 111(3) of these Practice Directions, clarifying or supplementing his evidence with oral testimony. Upon completion of evidence-in-chief, the witness will then be cross-examined. Where a witness is cross-examined by more than one party, the Court shall determine the order in which the other parties cross-examine the witnesses. Counsel are expected to comply with the rules of evidence found in Singapore law, whether under the Evidence Act (Cap. 97) or elsewhere, or other applicable evidential rules if any rule of evidence found in Singapore law has been disapplied pursuant to an order under Order 110, Rule 23 of the Rules of Court. Counsel are also expected to comply with all relevant ethical codes in the conduct of the cross-examination. Unless expressly allowed by the Court, once the witness commences cross-examination, the witness shall not be permitted to discuss his evidence with anyone, including any counsel, until that witness is released from his oath after re-examination. Upon completion of cross-examination(s), the witness shall be re-examined by the party who called the witness. The Court may, at any time, ask the witness questions. Where the questions elicit answers which parties have not previously dealt with, the Court shall allow parties a reasonable opportunity to direct questions to that witness on the answers given. The Court may, where appropriate, direct that cross-examination and re-examination be conducted on an issue by issue basis. The witness will be cross-examined and re-examined on the first issue, then cross-examined and re-examined on the second issue, and so on."

Order 34, Rule 3A of the Rules of Court requires the affidavits of evidence-in-chief of all witnesses, a bundle of documents and the opening statements to be filed no less than 5 working days before the trial of an action. In addition, to improve the conduct of civil proceedings and to reduce the time taken in the presentation of cases in Court, the respective counsel of the parties shall also prepare a bundle of authorities, which shall also be filed and served along with the documents on all relevant parties. Strict adherence to the timelines for filing Trial Bundles Parties are to note that the timeline in Order 34, Rule 3A of the Rules of Court (i.e. no less than 5 working days before the trial) is to be adhered to strictly. If an adjournment of the trial is necessitated by the failure to comply with the timeline for filing the trial bundle, the Court may impose costs or other sanctions against the party in default. Bundles of documents The bundle of documents required to be filed by Order 34, Rule 3A of the Rules of Court should be paginated consecutively throughout the top right hand corner and may be printed on one side or both sides of each page. An index of contents of each bundle in the manner and form set out in Form 17 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions must also be furnished. No bundle of documents is necessary in cases where parties are not relying on any document at the trial. Under Order 34, Rule 3A(3) of the Rules of Court, it is the responsibility of counsel for all parties to agree and prepare an agreed bundle of documents as soon as possible. The scope to which the agreement extends must be stated in the index sheet of the agreed bundle. The documents in the bundles should: be firmly secured together with plastic ring binding or plastic spine thermal binding. The rings or spinets should be red for plaintiffs and blue for defendants with a transparent plastic cover in front and at the back; have flags to mark out documents to which repeated references will be made in the course of hearing.

Where originals and copies of documents are included in one bundle, it should be stated in the index which documents are originals and which are copies. Only documents which are relevant or necessary for the trial shall be included in the bundles. In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of unnecessary documents, the Court may impose costs or other sanctions against the relevant person. A core bundle should also be provided, unless one is clearly unnecessary. The core bundle should contain the most important documents upon which the case will turn or to which repeated reference will have to be made. The documents in this bundle should not only be paginated but should also be cross-referenced to copies of the documents included in the main bundles. The bundle supplied to the Court should be contained in a loose-leaf file which can easily have further documents added to it if required."

(4A) Parties are to take note of the following when preparing their Cases: Parties should ensure that all documents which they refer to in their submissions (whether in their Cases or in the oral submissions) are contained in the core bundle or the supplemental core bundle. As a matter of practice, parties should not be making submissions based on documents contained solely in the record of appeal unless they are responding to questions from the coram; and Any document referred to in a Case should be suitably described in such a manner as to allow the court to identify the nature of the document. Parties’ attention is drawn to paragraph 148(6A) for illustrations of suitable descriptions. Page limits for Appellant’s Case and Respondent’s Case in matters before the Court of Appeal The Appellant’s Case and the Respondent’s Case in matters before the Court of Appeal shall not exceed 50 pages unless leave of the Court of Appeal is obtained. The Appellant’s Reply, if any, shall not exceed 30 pages unless leave of the Court of Appeal is obtained. The process for obtaining leave of the Court of Appeal may be found in paragraph 146 of these Practice Directions. Any Appellant’s Case, Respondent’s Case, and Appellant’s Reply in breach of this requirement will be rejected. The cover page and backing page shall be excluded from any computation of the number of pages.

Further, a table of contents must be included for these documents. These documents must be paginated consecutively at the centre top of the page and counsel must ensure that the pagination takes into account the pages comprising the respective forms of appeal bundles and the table of contents for these additional documents. For example, if the form of the core bundle is 5 pages and the table of contents for the additional documents is 2 pages, the first page of the first document should be paginated as page 8."

"text": "Preparation of appeal records in hearings of civil appeals to the Court of Appeal For the purpose of this paragraph, “appeal records” means the Record of Appeal and Core Bundles to be used in hearings of civil appeals to the Court of Appeal. Arrangement of Record of Appeal This sub-paragraph sets out the manner of arranging the Record of Appeal. To facilitate cross-referencing, the Record of Appeal shall be arranged in the following separate volumes: Volume I – Judgment or grounds of decision and the engrossed order of Court of judgment appealed from. Volume II – Notice of appeal, certificate of security for costs and pleadings (to include all originating processes). Volume III – Affidavits (in chronological order), and transcripts or notes of evidence and arguments. Volume IV – All such exhibits and documents as they were tendered in the Court below, but which did not form an exhibit to any affidavit. Volume V – The Agreed Bundle (if any) in its original physical form as it was tendered in the Court below. Where there are no exhibits or documents referred to in sub-paragraph (2)(a)(iv) above, Volume IV need not be produced, and Volume V shall be renumbered as Volume IV. If any volume exceeds 300 pages, then that volume shall be sub-divided, at a convenient page, into sub-volumes designated as part thereof, for example, Volume III Part A, Volume III Part B and so on. Conversely, if any of the volumes (with the exception of Volumes I and II which shall remain as separate volumes) should be less than 100 pages each, these may be amalgamated into combined volumes, each not exceeding 300 pages, and renumbered accordingly. The following additional directions shall apply to the form of the Record of Appeal: The documents in Volumes I, II, and III shall be arranged strictly in the order stated in sub-paragraph (2)(a) above. The documentary exhibits in Volume IV shall be arranged in the most convenient way for the use of the Court, as the circumstances of the case require. The documents shall, as far as suitable, be arranged in chronological order, mixing plaintiff’s and defendant’s documents together when necessary (for example, in a series of correspondence). If proceedings in a suit other than the one under appeal appear as exhibits, then these shall be kept together. However, the documents from each suit shall be arranged in the chronological order of the suits. Each document in Volume IV shall show its exhibit mark and whether it is the plaintiff’s or the defendant’s document, unless this is clear from the mark. Pagination in soft copy This sub-paragraph sets out the manner of paginating the soft copy of the appeal records. The first page of each volume shall state the title and the Civil Appeal number of the appeal, the names of the parties, the volume number, a short description of its contents, the names and addresses of the appellants and respondents, and the date of filing. The page number of each volume of the appeal records must correspond to the page number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of that volume. Each separate volume of the appeal records shall start at page 1 and every page shall be numbered consecutively. If separator sheets are used, these shall also be numbered. Table of contents This sub-paragraph sets out the format of the table of contents for appeal records. The table of contents of all volumes of the records shall be placed at the beginning of Volume I, immediately after the first title page in the manner and form set out in Form 22 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions. Each volume and, if any, parts thereof, shall also contain its own index of the contents. Items in the table of contents shall be numbered serially, and listed in the order in which they are found in the records. The items relating to the transcripts or notes of the evidence of witnesses shall have a sub-table of contents of the evidence of each witness, and the number and name of each witness shall be shown in such sub-table. If an exhibit consists of a bundle of documents, then the documents in the bundle shall be listed in a sub-table of contents under the item relating to such bundle. Electronic bookmarks for each item of the table of contents and sub-table of contents must be added to each volume of the PDF version of the appeal records. The description of each bookmark shall correspond with the description of that item in the table of contents or sub-table of contents, unless an abbreviated description is appropriate. Spacing The line spacing on every page of the records of which the original is type-written (e.g., notice of appeal) shall be double-spaced. Core bundles – Order 57, Rule 9(2A) of the Rules of Court The documents to be included in the core bundle are stipulated in Order 57, Rule 9(2A) of the Rules of Court. The contents of the core bundle shall be arranged in the following separate volumes: Volume I – a copy of the grounds of the judgment or order, the judgment or order appealed from and an index of the documents included therein. Volume II – all other documents referred to in Order 57, Rule 9(2A), and an index of the documents included therein. Each volume of the core bundle shall begin at page 1, every page shall be numbered and the page number of the core bundle shall correspond to the page number of the Portable Document Format (PDF) version. (6A) The indexes of the core bundle and supplemental core bundle shall correspond with the indexes of documents found in the form of core bundle and form of supplemental core bundle filed under paragraph 145(3) of these Practice Directions. Any document listed in the indexes should be suitably described in such a manner as to allow the Court to identify the nature of the document. Examples of suitable descriptions are set out below for reference: Joint Venture Agreement between Party A and Party B dated 1 December 2017; Minutes of meeting held on 1 December 2017 between Party A and Party B; and Email dated 1 December 2017 from Party A and Party B. Parties should avoid the use of generic description such as “extracts from the affidavit of Party A filed on 1 December 2017” “or exhibits from the affidavit of Party A filed on 1 December 2017”. Responsibility for good order and completeness of appeal records The counsel having the conduct of the appeal may delegate the preparation of the appeal records to an assistant or a suitably experienced law clerk or secretary, provided always that that counsel shall personally satisfy himself as to the good order and completeness of every copy of the appeal records lodged in Court in accordance with these Practice Directions, paragraph 148A included, and shall personally bear responsibility for any errors or deficiencies. Superfluous, irrelevant and duplicate documents With regard to the inclusion of documents, counsel’s attention is drawn to the provisions of Order 57, Rules 9(2), (2A), (3) as well as Order 57, Rules 9A(2A) and 5(C) of the Rules of Court. Only documents which are relevant to the subject matter of the appeal, or, in the case of Core Bundles and Supplemental Core Bundles, will be referred to in the Cases, shall be included in the appeal records. Parties are reminded not to exhibit duplicate documents in their Supplemental Core Bundle if such documents are already included in a Core Bundle or Supplemental Core Bundle that has been filed earlier. Documents shall not appear more than once in the records, even if exhibited to different affidavits. The Court of Appeal may impose costs or other sanctions in cases in which it is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of superfluous, irrelevant or duplicate documents."

"text": "148A. Inclusion in appeal bundles of documents ordered to be sealed or redacted (1) This paragraph applies only where certain documents tendered before the court below have been ordered to be sealed or redacted. (2) Counsel should carefully consider whether it is necessary to include in the record of appeal, core bundle or supplemental core bundle (collectively known as “appeal bundles”) any document that has been ordered to be sealed or redacted, having regard to paragraph 148(8) of these Practice Directions. Inclusion of redacted documents in appeal bundles (3) Where it is necessary to include in the appeal bundles documents that have been ordered to be redacted, parties should do so by complying with the following directions: All documents subjected to a redaction order should not be included in the appeal bundles in their unredacted form. Instead, such documents should be included in the appeal bundles in their redacted form. In the margins against the redacted portions of the appeal bundles, the basis for the redaction should be stated (for example, “This information has been redacted pursuant to SIC/ORC 1/2017 made on 3 January 2017”). When tendering the appeal bundles, the parties should also tender a separate bundle, consisting only of documents subjected to a redaction order. These documents should be included in this bundle in their unredacted form (the “Bundle of Documents Subjected to Redaction Order” or “BDSRO”). The BDSRO should be tendered in both hard copies and soft copies. Where hard copies are concerned, parties should tender the number of copies as provided in paragraph 147(2) of these Practice Directions. Where soft copies are concerned, the BDSRO may be included in the CD-ROM mentioned in paragraph 147(3) of these Practice Directions and should be named in the format provided in paragraph 147(4) of these Practice Directions. The BDSRO should contain a table of contents. The format of the table of contents should comply with that provided in paragraph 148(4) of these Practice Directions. The pagination of the documents in the BDSRO should follow the pagination of the corresponding documents in the appeal bundles. Fresh pagination should not be assigned to the documents in the BDSRO. At the time when the parties tender the appeal bundles and the BDSRO, they should by way of a letter to the Legal Registry: (i) inform the Legal Registry that the BDSRO contains redacted information, (ii) specify the basis for the redaction; and (iii) request that the Legal Registry seal the BDSRO in the electronic case file and keep the hard copies from public inspection. (4) Counsel are reminded of their responsibility under paragraph 148(7) to personally satisfy themselves as to the good order of the appeal records. At the time the appeal bundles and BDSRO are tendered, the counsel having conduct of the appeal shall provide an undertaking to the Court that he has satisfied himself that the appeal bundles do not contain any document ordered to be redacted in its unredacted form. This undertaking shall be in Form 23 of Appendix B to these Practice Directions. Inclusion of sealed documents in appeal bundles (5) Where it is necessary to include in the appeal bundles documents that have been ordered to be sealed, parties should do so by complying with the following directions: All documents subjected to a sealing order should not be included in the appeal bundles. Instead, each and every such document should be represented in the appeal bundles by a separate holding page. Each and every holding page should be blank save that: (i) the basis for the sealing should be stated across each holding page (for example, “The affidavit of Tan filed on 30 December 2016 has been sealed pursuant to SIC/ORC 1/2017 made on 3 January 2017”); and (ii) the cross-references required under sub-paragraph (5)(f) should be indicated (for example, “Reference: BDSSO – Pages 1-10”). When tendering the appeal bundles, the parties should also tender a separate bundle, consisting only of documents subjected to a sealing order (the “Bundle of Documents Subjected to Sealing Order” or “BDSSO”). The BDSSO should be tendered both in hard copies and soft copies. Where hard copies are concerned, parties should tender the number of copies as is provided in paragraph 147(2) of these Practice Directions. Where soft copies are concerned, the BDSSO may be included in the CD-ROM mentioned in paragraph 147(3) of these Practice Directions and should be named in the format provided in paragraph 147(4) of these Practice Directions. The BDSSO should contain a table of contents. The format of the table of contents should comply with that provided in paragraph 148(4) of these Practice Directions. Given that each and every document subjected to a sealing order is represented only by a single holding page in the appeal bundles but is reproduced in full in the BDSSO, fresh pagination will have to be assigned to the pages in the BDSSO. Each holding page should contain cross-references to the pages of the BDSSO that the holding page represents (for example, “Reference: BDSSO – Pages 1-10”). At the time when the parties tender the appeal bundles and the BDSSO, they must by way of a letter to the Legal Registry: (i) inform the Legal Registry that the BDSSO contains documents ordered to be sealed, (ii) specify the basis for the sealing; and (iii) request that the Legal Registry seal the BDSSO in the electronic case file and keep the hard copies from public inspection. Counsel are reminded of their responsibility under paragraph 148(7) to personally satisfy themselves as to the good order of the appeal records. At the time the appeal bundles and BDSSO are tendered, the solicitor having conduct of the appeal shall provide an undertaking to the Court that he has satisfied himself that the appeal bundles do not contain any document ordered to be sealed. This undertaking shall be in Form 23 of Appendix B to these Practice Directions. For the avoidance of doubt, documents that have been ordered to be expunged should not in any event be tendered to the Court of Appeal in any form."

The term “skeletal arguments” includes “skeletal submissions”, “written submissions”, “written arguments” and all other variant terms by which such documents are known. Counsel should submit skeletal arguments for the hearing of the appeal or matter and give a copy to counsel for the other parties. Hard copies of skeletal arguments may be printed on one side or both sides of each page. Skeletal arguments are abbreviated notes of the arguments that will be presented. Skeletal arguments are not formal documents and do not bind parties. They are a valuable tool to the Judges and are meant to expedite the hearing of the appeal. These notes should comply with the following requirements: they should contain a numbered list of the points proposed to be argued, stated in no more than one or 2 sentences; each listed point should be accompanied by a full reference to the material to which counsel will be referring, i.e., the relevant pages or passages in authorities, the record of appeal, the bundles of documents, affidavits, transcripts and the judgment under appeal; all pages should be paginated, with the first page (not including any cover page) numbered as “Page 1”; the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent; the print of every page shall be double-spaced; and every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35mm in width.

The skeletal arguments should be filed by tendering hard copies to the SICC Registry and filing, serving, delivering or otherwise conveying to the SICC Registry one soft copy in accordance with paragraph 44, 45 or 46 of these Practice Directions).

In relation to the hard copies referred to at sub-paragraph (6): Where the appeal is to be heard by a 2-judge Court, 3 hard copies should be tendered; Where the appeal is to be heard by a 3-judge Court, 4 hard copies should be tendered; and Where the appeal is to be heard by a 5-judge Court, 6 hard copies should be tendered. Parties whose skeletal arguments have been rejected for filing may re-file their skeletal arguments, provided they comply with sub-paragraphs (4) to (6) above. Further skeletal arguments for civil matters before the Court of Appeal (8A) Where the Court of Appeal orders further skeletal arguments (including any submissions on costs) to be filed for any civil matter, such skeletal arguments shall not exceed 10 pages unless otherwise directed by the Court of Appeal. Any skeletal arguments filed in breach of this requirement will be rejected. The cover page and backing page shall be excluded from any computation of the number of pages."

"text": "Further arguments before the Court of Appeal From time to time, requests are received for further arguments to be presented before the Court of Appeal after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal. Such requests should not be made as all relevant arguments should have been presented at the hearing proper. As a general rule, unless asked for by the Court of Appeal itself, the Court of Appeal will not receive further arguments after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal. The general rule will be relaxed in only very exceptional circumstances, for example, if an authority not available at the hearing would be decisive. Counsel seeking to submit further arguments should therefore satisfy themselves that very exceptional circumstances exist. If they are of the view that such circumstances do exist, they must also seek the consent of the other parties to their request. All requests for further arguments shall be made by submitting a request to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions and should: state the party making the requests; identify the Judges constituting the Court of Appeal who heard the matter in question; specify when the order concerned was made; state the very exceptional reasons which justify the request; state whether the other parties consent to the request; set out the proposed further arguments briefly, together with any authorities; and include a copy of each of the authorities cited. Any request for further arguments must be received by the Registrar within one week after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, failing which it cannot be considered and will be rejected. A copy of the request should be furnished to all parties concerned. All requests should be addressed to the Registrar."
