<p>(3) Not less than 7 working days before the day on which the services of an interpreter are required (“scheduled day”), the requesting party must file a Request addressed to the appropriate Head Interpreter from the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. The Request must be accompanied by Form 2A of Appendix B of these Practice Directions, in Portable Document Format (PDF).</p>

<p>(10) Engagement of private interpreters (i.e. interpreters not from the Supreme Court’s Interpreters Section):</p>

<h2 id="17-production-of-record-of-hearing">17. Production of record of hearing</h2>

<p>(1) There shall be audio recording of all hearings in open Court or Chambers at the Court unless the Court directs otherwise. Such audio recording shall be made using the Digital Transcription System (DTS) only.</p>

<p>(3) The provisions of sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) are subject to any directions made by the Court hearing the cause or matter, whether or not upon application by the parties. Such directions may include the use of alternative means of producing transcripts.</p>

<p>(4) Where the Court makes such directions under sub-paragraph (3):</p>

<h2 id="18-use-of-electronic-and-other-devices">18. Use of electronic and other devices</h2>

<p>(1) In order to maintain the dignity of Court proceedings, video and/or image recording is strictly prohibited in all hearings in open Court or Chambers before a Judge.</p>

<p>(2) Additionally, audio recording during a hearing is strictly prohibited without prior approval of the Judge hearing the matter.</p>

<p>(3) Court users are permitted to use notebooks, tablets, mobile phones and other electronic devices to:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) take notes of evidence and for other purposes pertaining to the proceedings in open Court or Chambers; or</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) communicate with external parties in all hearings in open Court,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>provided that such use does not in any way disrupt or trivialise the proceedings.</p>

<p>(4) The attention of court users is also drawn to section 5 of the Administration of Justice (Protection) Act 2016 (Act No. 19 of 2016).</p>

<h2 id="19-certification-of-transcripts">19. Certification of transcripts</h2>

<h2 id="20-access-to-case-file-inspection-obtaining-copies-and-searches">20. Access to case file, inspection, obtaining copies and searches</h2>

<p><em>Access by parties to a case file</em></p>

<p>(1) All parties to a case may, subject to this paragraph and any directions of the Court, access the online case file.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) Where a party to a case is a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service, that party may access the online case file through the Electronic Filing System directly and may inspect, download soft copies or print hard copies of documents accessible to the parties in the online case file.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) Where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service, or is unable to access the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service for any reason, he may either:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) submit a request in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions; or</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(ii) attend at the Service Bureau to seek assistance;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>to inspect or download copies of documents accessible to the parties in the online case file, or for hard copies of such documents to be provided. Printing charges may be chargeable by the Court or the Service Bureau for reproducing documents in paper form.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(2) All parties to a case shall have the liberty to make amendments at will to administrative details contained in the electronic case file through the Electronic Filing Service. Administrative details include the contact details of counsel, the identities of counsel, and the nature of the claim. Where a party to a case is not a registered user of the Electronic Filing Service or is unable to access the case file through the Electronic Filing Service, he may attend at the Service Bureau to seek assistance to amend the administrative details contained in the electronic case file.</p>

<p>(3) The SICC Registry may require parties to a case to provide supporting documents to substantiate proposed amendments to other details of the electronic case file before the amendment is allowed to be effected. For example, amendments to add or remove a party to the case have to be supported by an order of court; and amendments to change the name, gender, identification number, or marital status of a party to the case have to be substantiated by documentary proof.</p>

<p><em>File inspection and obtaining copies of documents by non-parties</em></p>

<p>(4) In order to inspect a case file, the following procedure should be followed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>(a) A request Formerly known as “praecipe” must be made to obtain leave to inspect the file. The request shall be in Form 3 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions and filed in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. The request shall state the following:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) the name of the person who is to carry out the search or inspection. If this person is not a counsel representing the non-party, his identity card or passport number should also be included in the request after his name, and a copy of his identity card or passport should be provided;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(ii) the interest that the applicant has in the matter; and</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(iii) the reason for the search or inspection. If the search or inspection is requested for the purpose of ascertaining information for use in a separate suit or matter, the request should clearly state the nature of the information sought and the relevance of such information to the separate suit or matter.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(b) Once approval for inspection has been received from the Court:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(i) registered users can inspect the case file online through the Electronic Filing Service;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>(ii) parties who are not registered users can inspect the case file by presenting a copy of the approval at the Service Bureau.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(c) After verifying the approval, the Service Bureau will assign the inspecting party a personal computer for the inspection to be carried out.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>(d) An inspecting party will usually be allowed 60 minutes to carry out the inspection. If a longer period is required, the Service Bureau may impose a charge for use of the computer. The Service Bureau may impose additional charges for downloading soft copies or printing hard copies of documents from the case file being inspected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(5) A case file which has been sealed, whether under Order 110, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court or otherwise, shall not be inspected by a non-party to those proceedings unless leave of Court is obtained pursuant to Order 110, Rule 30(10) and (11) of the Rules of Court.</p>

<p>(6) Counsel must communicate to the Registrar in writing the names of persons authorised by them to make searches and inspections. Such authority may be in respect of a specific search or inspection or for a specified period.</p>

<p>(7) For the avoidance of doubt, a non-party who has obtained approval to inspect a case file may take and retain a soft copy of any document that is available for inspection. All copies of documents taken in the course of inspection should not be used for purposes other than those stated in the request to inspect unless leave is obtained from the Court. Counsel shall be responsible for informing their clients of this.</p>

<p><em>Obtaining certified true copies of documents</em></p>

<h2 id="electronic-payment-of-fees-and-charges">Electronic payment of fees and charges</h2>

<p><em>Implementation of the electronic system for the payment of fees</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Notwithstanding anything in these Practice Directions, all deposits, fees and charges not paid using the Electronic Filing Service must be paid by electronic means.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Modes of electronic payment</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Payment through electronic means includes payment effected by wire transfer (e.g. SWIFT), Interbank GIRO (IBG), NETS, Cashcards and selected credit cards.</li>
      <li>Save that payments of fees for the purposes of becoming a Registered Foreign Lawyer or a Registered Law Expert may be made using selected credit cards through an online payment portal, payment through NETS, Cashcards and selected credit cards may only be effected at the Supreme Court cashier’s counter.</li>
      <li>For Singapore law practices and law firms with a presence in Singapore, payment by IBG would be the most appropriate mode of electronic payment. A law firm using IBG will authorise the Supreme Court to deduct the fees from its bank account upon lodgement of the prescribed lodgement form. The law firm will receive detailed reports on its IBG payments to facilitate accounting and help with bank reconciliation.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Scope of electronic payment</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The electronic payment covers all fees, including court fees, hearing fees (whether the hearing is held in Court, by teleconference or video conference) and all other fees and charges for services or otherwise that may be payable to the Court in relation to proceedings in the Court.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Registrar’s discretion</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The Registrar may, in any case, waive the requirements for payment to be effected by electronic means, on such terms and conditions as he deems fit.</li>

      <li>Where it is impracticable for a Full Registration Foreign Lawyer to file, serve, deliver or otherwise convey documents to the Registrar using the Electronic Filing Service in accordance with sub-paragraphs (2) or (3) above, a request for assistance to record such documents in the Electronic Filing Service may be made to the Registrar.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>(4A) Where the request for assistance under sub-paragraph (4) is made, the documents may be sent or made accessible to the Registrar:</p>

Full Registration Foreign Lawyers are required to make prior arrangements with the SICC Registry for access to such online folders before this option may be utilised.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>The documents sent or made accessible by Full Registration Foreign Lawyers to the Registrar, under sub-paragraph (4A), will be recorded by the SICC Registry in the Court’s electronic case file using the Electronic Filing Service under sub-paragraph (4), only after the requisite filing fees are received by the SICC Registry.

      <li>
        <ol>
          <li>the act of sending or making accessible documents to the Registrar by the means set out in sub-paragraph (4A) does not constitute the filing or service of the documents. Such documents shall be deemed filed only when the documents are recorded by the SICC Registry in the Court’s electronic case file using the Electronic Filing Service. The SICC Registry will not assist in effecting service of documents. Parties are reminded that they must comply with any requirement to serve documents as provided in the Rules of Court or directed by the Court.</li>
          <li>the party requesting the assistance of the Registrar, under sub-paragraph (4), to record documents in the Court’s electronic case file using the Electronic Filing Service remains fully responsible for complying with any timeline or requirement that exists for the filing or service of such documents.

    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Parties are reminded not to transmit voluminous documents by electronic mail and should instead use the transmission methods set out at sub-paragraph (4)(b) or (4)(c) for such documents. In any event, parties must ensure that the size of each electronic mail sent to the SICC Registry does not exceed 20 MB.</li>
      <li>For the avoidance of doubt, section 13 of the Electronic Transactions Act (Cap. 88) shall apply for the determination of the time and place of despatch and receipt of documents sent or made accessible to the Registrar under sub-paragraph (4A). For the purpose of section 13(2) of the Electronic Transactions Act (Cap. 88), the Registrar hereby designates:
        <ol>
          <li>the following electronic address <a href="mailto:Supcourt_SICCRegistry@supcourt.gov.sg">Supcourt_SICCRegistry@supcourt.gov.sg</a> in respect of documents sent by the means set out under sub-paragraph (4A)(a) above; and</li>

For example, “Japanese Identification Card No.”.</li>
          <li>Deceased person: For a deceased natural person, the identification number shall be as set out in sub-paragraph (7)(a) to (7)(d) above.

The number as well as the following words should be stated: “(Country or place of registration of death) Death Reg. No.”.</li>

          <li>Other bodies and associations: For any other body or association, whether incorporated or otherwise, which does not fall within sub-paragraph (7)(f) to (7)(i) above, the identification number shall be any unique number assigned to the body or association by any authority. Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority assigning the number to be ascertained should be stated. For example, “Singapore Trade Union Reg. No. 123 A”.</li>
          <li>Ship or vessel: For a ship or vessel, the identification number shall be the registration number assigned by the port of registry. If no such registration number is available, the identification number assigned by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) or the number of the licence granted by any authority shall be the identification number.</li>
          <li>No identification numbers exist: Where the appropriate identification numbers prescribed by sub-paragraphs (7)(a) to (7)(k) above do not exist, the following words should be stated immediately below or after the name of the party, person, entity or property concerned: “(No ID No. exists)”.</li>

      <li>The directions in this paragraph shall apply to documents and pleadings filed in any proceedings in the Court.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Amendment of any document</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Where a document is required to be amended and filed in Court, a fresh copy of the document with the amendments included must be prepared, regardless of the number and length of the amendments sought to be made.</li>
      <li>The procedure for amending a document is as follows:
        <ol>
          <li>a fresh amended copy of the document should be produced.</li>
          <li>the number of times the document has been amended shall be indicated in parentheses after the name of the document. It should therefore be entitled “[document name] (Amendment No. 1)” or “[document name] (Amendment No. 2)” as appropriate.</li>
          <li>the changes made in the document from the latest version of the document filed in Court should be indicated in the following way:
            <ol>
              <li>deletions shall be made by drawing a single line across the words to be deleted; and</li>
              <li>insertions shall be underlined.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The directions in sub-paragraph (3)(b) shall not apply to originating summonses and summonses amended from an <em>inter partes</em> application to an <em>ex parte</em> application or vice versa.</li>
      <li>The directions in sub-paragraph (3)(c) shall not apply to the originating processes, summonses and other electronic forms that are composed online through the Electronic Filing Service.</li>
      <li>Where the amendments are so numerous or of such a nature or length that to make written alterations of the document would make it difficult or inconvenient to read, the amended document should comprise two versions:
        <ol>
          <li>a clean version without the amendments shown; followed in the same document by</li>
          <li>a version showing the amendments in colour.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Where the document being amended is a writ, the amended writ must be reissued.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>A writ, pleading or other documents which has been amended must be endorsed with a statement that it has been amended, specifying the date on which it was amended and by whom the Order (if any) authorising the amendment was made and the date thereof, or, if no such order was made, the particular Rule in Order 20 of the Rules of Court pursuant to which the amendment was made.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Amendment of pleadings</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The directions in sub-paragraphs (2), (3) and (7) shall apply to the amendment of pleadings. A Statement of Claim which is amended for the first time should be filed as “Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1)” and a Defence that is amended for the second time should be filed as “Defence (Amendment No. 2)”.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Colour schemes for amendments</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The following colours shall be used to indicate the history of the amendments in the pleadings:
        <ol>
          <li>black for the first round of amendments;</li>
          <li>red for the second round of amendments;</li>
          <li>green for the third round of amendments;</li>
          <li>blue for the fourth round of amendments; and</li>
          <li>brown for subsequent rounds of amendments.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Amendments for third time or more</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>From the third round of amendments onwards, the amended pleading should comprise two versions of the document:
        <ol>
          <li>a clean version without the amendments shown; followed in the same document by</li>
          <li>a version showing the amendments in colour.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Only one amended pleading consisting of these two versions is required to be filed.</p>

<p><em>Amendment endorsements on electronic forms</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Order 20, Rule 10(2) of the Rules of Court requires that an amended pleading or other document be endorsed with a statement that it has been amended, specifying the date on which it was amended and by whom the order (if any) authorising the amendment was made and the date thereof, and if no such order was made, the number of the Rule in Order 20 pursuant to which the amendment was made. Where electronic forms are amended, the amendment endorsement shall take either one of the following forms:
        <ol>
          <li>by order of court made on [date order was made]; or</li>
          <li>pursuant to Order 20, Rule [cite specific rule number].</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The amendment endorsement shall be appended to the title of the electronic form, after the amendment number as required under sub-paragraph (3)(b) above. Where an electronic form is amended more than once, the endorsement need only cite the basis for the most recent amendment. For example,</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>“Originating Summons (Amendment No 3,</p>

<p>by order of court made on 1 January 2013)”</p>

<p>“Writ of Summons (Amendment No 1, pursuant to O 20, r 3)”</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The date of the electronic form shall reflect the date on which the document is amended.</li>

<h2 id="personal-service-of-processes-and-documents">Personal service of processes and documents</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Subject to the provisions of any written law and the Rules of Court, all originating processes must be served personally on each defendant. The provisions of Order 10 and Order 62 of the Rules of Court in relation to personal service of documents shall apply in this regard.</li>
      <li>The attention of counsel is drawn to Order 62, Rule 2(1) of the Rules of Court which provides:</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>“Personal service must be effected by a process server of the Supreme Court or by a solicitor or <strong>a solicitor’s clerk whose name and particulars have been notified to the Registrar for this purpose</strong>:</p>

<p>Provided that the Registrar may, in a particular cause or matter, allow personal service to be effected by any other named person and shall, in that case, cause to be marked on the document required to be served personally, a memorandum to that effect.” [Emphasis added.]</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Counsel are required to notify the SICC Registry of the particulars of such clerks who have been authorised by them to serve processes and documents (“authorised process servers”) by submitting a request to authorise user in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. Counsel’s clerks do not require the authorisation of the Registrar to effect personal service of processes and documents.</li>
      <li>As personal service can be effected by counsel or counsel’s clerks, Court process servers will not be assigned to effect personal service of processes and documents unless there are special reasons.</li>
      <li>If there are special reasons requiring personal service by a Court process server, a request for such service should be submitted to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions, setting out the special reasons. The approval of the Duty Registrar should then be obtained for such service. Once approval has been obtained, a process server will be assigned to effect service and an appointment for service convenient to both the litigant and the assigned process server will be given.</li>
      <li>On the appointed date, the person accompanying the Court process server should call at the SICC Registry. The amount required for the transport charges of the Court process server (a record of which will be kept) should be tendered. Alternatively, the SICC Registry should be informed beforehand that transport for the Court process server will be provided. The SICC Registry will then instruct the Court process server to effect service.</li>
      <li>Under no circumstances should any payment be made directly to the Court process server.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="service-out-of-jurisdiction">Service out of jurisdiction</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Where an originating process, summons, notice or order issued, given or made in any proceedings to which Order 110 of the Rules of Court applies is to be served outside of Singapore, leave under Order 11, Rules 1, 8 or Order 69A, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court is not required if service is on a party to a written jurisdiction agreement. In all other circumstances, leave for service out of jurisdiction should be obtained under Order 11 or Order 69A, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court.</li>
      <li>An application for leave to serve an originating process outside of Singapore shall be made in the manner set out in Order 11, Rule 2(1) or Order 69A, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court. The Court shall not grant leave unless it shall be made sufficiently appear to the Court that the case is a proper one for service out of Singapore.</li>
      <li>The modes by which service of an originating process may be made out of jurisdiction are set out in Order 11, Rules 3 to 7 of the Rules of Court.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="substituted-service">Substituted service</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The provisions of Order 62, Rule 5 of the Rules of Court shall apply with regard to the substituted service of documents in cases where it appears to the Court that personal service of such documents is impractical.</li>
      <li>An application for an order for substituted service shall be made in the manner set out in Order 62, Rule 5(2) of the Rules of Court. The Court shall, on any such application, have the discretion to authorise the service of documents in such manner as the Court is satisfied will probably be effectual in bringing such documents to the notice of the person to be served.</li>
      <li>In any application for substituted service, the applicant should persuade the Court that the proposed mode of substituted service will probably be effectual in bringing the document in question to the notice of the person to be served.</li>
      <li>Two reasonable attempts at personal service should be made before an application for an order for substituted service is filed. In an application for substituted service, the applicant shall demonstrate by way of affidavit why he believes that the attempts at service made were reasonable.</li>
      <li>The applicant should, where appropriate, also consider other modes of substituted service, such as AR registered post or electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet transmission) in addition to or in substitution of substituted service by posting on doors or gates of residential and business premises.</li>
      <li>An application for substituted service by posting at an address or by AR registered post should contain evidence (for example, relevant search results from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, the Singapore Land Authority, the Housing &amp; Development Board or the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority) that the person to be served is resident or can be located at the property.</li>
      <li>For the avoidance of doubt, substituted service by AR registered post is deemed to be effected when the postal service has delivered the document, or attempted to deliver the document (in cases where no one is present or willing to accept the document).</li>
      <li>If substituted service is by electronic mail, it has to be shown that the electronic mail account to which the document will be sent belongs to the person to be served and that it is currently active.</li>
      <li>An application for substituted service by advertisement should only be considered as a last resort and should contain evidence that the person to be served is literate in the language of the newspaper in which the advertisement will be placed.</li>
      <li>The Court shall, in the exercise of its discretion referred to in sub-paragraph (2) above, give directions as to the manner in which the mode of service is to be effected, including (without limitation):
    1.  The content of any notice that must accompany the document to be served, explaining the nature of the document to be served, the steps that the Recipient must take upon receipt of the document and the possible consequences should the Recipient not take any action; and
    2.  The filing of an affidavit of service by the party effecting service of the document confirming that the directions of the Court have been adhered to.</li>

      <li>For the purposes of Order 62, Rule 6(1)(e), and without limiting the scope of Order 62, Rule 6(4) of the Rules of Court, the manner in which the Court may direct service of any document to be effected shall include by way of courier, e-mail and social media.</li>

      <li>Where the service of any document is effected before 4:00 p.m. on a working day, it shall, for the purpose of computing any period of time after service of that document, be deemed to have been served on that working day and, in any other case, on the next working day.</li>
      <li>For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these directions shall be construed as prescribing the hours within which service must be effected in order to be valid.</li>
      <li>An affidavit of service of any document must be in Form 138 of the Rules of Court and must state by whom the document was served, the day of the week and date on which it was served, where it was served and how.</li>
      <li>Where any document is required to be served on any person but is not required to be served personally, and at the time when service is to be effected that person is in default as to entry of appearance or has no address for service, then that document need not be served on that person unless otherwise provided in the Rules of Court or directed by the Court.</li>
      <li>The Court may, in an appropriate case, dispense with service of any document on any person.</li>

<h2 id="case-memorandum">Case Memorandum</h2>

<ul>
  <li>

      <li>The Case Memorandum shall contain:
        <ol>
          <li>a short and uncontroversial description of what the case is about; and</li>

        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The Case Memorandum does not play any part in the trial. It is therefore unnecessary for parties to be unduly concerned about the precise terms in which it is drafted, provided it contains a reasonably fair and balanced description of the case.</li>

      <li>The List of Issues should identify the principal issues in a structured manner. Parties are reminded to avoid long lists of detailed issues; sub-issues should only be identified where there is a specific purpose in doing so.</li>
      <li>The List of Issues:
        <ol>
          <li>is a document for use as a case management tool (e.g. to determine issues such as scope of documents to be produced, factual and expert evidence, and whether there are issues which may be summarily or preliminarily determined); and</li>
          <li>does not supersede the parties’ pleadings in the case. In the event of any conflict between the pleadings and the List of Issues, the pleadings shall prevail.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The Judge will, at his discretion, discuss with the parties and approve the List of Issues at the first or any subsequent Case Management Conference.

      <li>The Judge may require parties to provide clarification in relation to the information set out in the Proposed Case Management Plan or any other additional information as the Judge deems fit. When so directed by the Court, the parties shall provide to the Court (and copied to all other parties) such information in accordance with the timelines stipulated in paragraph 76(3) above, or otherwise in accordance with any timelines that the Judge may direct.</li>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Parties are reminded that once trial dates have been fixed, the postponement or vacation of such dates will be a measure of last resort.

          <li>directing parties to comply with expedited or contracted timelines;</li>

      <li>The purpose of the Progress Monitoring Information Sheet is to inform the Court whether:
        <ol>
          <li>parties have complied with the pre-trial timetable, and if not, the respect in which they have not been complied with; and</li>
          <li>parties will be ready for trial commencing on the fixed date(s) specified in the pre-trial timetable, and if they will not be ready, the reasons why they are unable to meet the date(s) specified.</li>

  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The Court will, as a default practice, direct that the experts meet before trial to discuss their respective reports, to determine where they are in agreement on the issues, and, where they do not agree, the extent of their disagreement. The parties and their lawyers will not be permitted to attend these expert meetings unless otherwise directed by the Court. The experts will thereafter be expected to prepare a joint experts’ report setting out:
        <ol>
          <li>a list of issues and/or technical issues;</li>
          <li>areas/issues where they are agreed;</li>

          <li>the preparation of a joint experts’ report.</li>

For this purpose, an experts’ meeting may be directed for experts to:
        <ol>
          <li>discuss without the presence of counsel (unless such presence is otherwise directed by the Court); and</li>
          <li>agree on the list of issues and the order in which expert evidence on those issues are to be given.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>Subject to paragraph 95 of these Practice Directions, requests for reasonable searches shall not extend to electronically stored documents which are not reasonably accessible unless the conditions in this paragraph are met. A party requesting a reasonable search for electronically stored documents which are not reasonably accessible must demonstrate that the relevance and materiality of the electronically stored documents justify the cost and burden of retrieving and producing them.</li>
      <li>The obligations of a party responding to a request for reasonable search for electronically stored documents is fulfilled upon that party carrying out the search to the extent stated in the request and producing any electronically stored documents located as a result of that search. The party producing documents shall not be required to review the search results for relevance.</li>

      <li>The language and layout of the forms are intended to make it easier for persons served with these orders to understand what they mean. These forms of orders should be used save to the extent that the Judge hearing the application considers there is a good reason for adopting a different form. Any departure from the terms of the prescribed forms should be justified by the applicant in his supporting affidavit(s).</li>
      <li>The applicant should undertake not to inform any third party of the proceedings until after the return date.</li>
      <li>Where practicable, applications should be made sufficiently early so as to ensure that the Judge has sufficient time to read and consider the application in advance.</li>
      <li>On an <em>ex parte</em> application for either a <em>Mareva</em> injunction or search order, an applicant may be required, in an appropriate case, to support his cross-undertaking in damages by payment to be made into Court, a bond to be issued by an insurance company with a place of business within Singapore, a written guarantee to be issued from a bank with a place of business within Singapore or any other mode which the Court deems fit.</li>

<h2 id="execution-of-a-search-order">Execution of a search order</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The attention of counsel is drawn to <em>Universal Thermosensors Ltd v Hibben</em> [1992] 1 WLR 840 at 861 where it was suggested that a search order be served by a supervising solicitor and carried out in his presence and under his supervision:
        <ol>
          <li>The supervising solicitor should be an experienced solicitor who is not a member or employee of the firm acting for the applicant and who has some familiarity with the operation of search orders. The evidence in support of the application should include the identity and experience of the proposed supervising solicitor.</li>
          <li>Where the premises are likely to be occupied by an unaccompanied woman, at least one of the persons attending on the service of the order should be a woman.</li>
          <li>Where the nature of the items removed under the order makes this appropriate, the applicant will be required to insure them.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>In this regard, the supervising solicitor should be an Advocate and Solicitor.</li>

<h2 id="foreign-law">Foreign law</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The Court may, pursuant to Order 110, Rule 25 of the Rules of Court and upon an application of a party, order that any question of foreign law arising in any cause or matter in the Court be determined on the basis of submissions instead of proof.</li>
      <li>In making the order referred to in sub-paragraph (1), the Court must be satisfied that each party is or will be represented by counsel, a Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or a Registered Law Expert who is suitable and competent to submit on the relevant questions of foreign law. For this purpose, the Court may require that party to provide evidence attesting to the suitability of the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or Registered Law Expert (including evidence of good standing).</li>
      <li>Where the order referred to in sub-paragraph (1) is made, and a foreign lawyer or law expert wishes to make submissions on the relevant questions of foreign law on behalf of any party, the foreign lawyer or law expert may do so provided that:
        <ol>
          <li>the foreign lawyer or law expert is registered under sections 36P or 36PA of the Legal Profession Act (Cap. 161); and</li>
          <li>the foreign lawyer or law expert is named in the said order as being authorised to make submissions on the relevant question of foreign law.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>In assessing competence for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2), the Court may consider:
        <ol>
          <li>The experience of the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or Registered Law Expert in practising the foreign law or subject matter in question;</li>
          <li>The qualifications of the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or Registered Law Expert in relation to the foreign law or the subject matter in question; and</li>
          <li>The proficiency of the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or Registered Law Expert in the language in which the foreign law in question is in.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>In assessing the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or Registered Law Expert for the purposes of sub-paragraph (2), the Court may take into account its own competence in the foreign law or subject matter in question and proficiency in the language in which the foreign law in question is in.</li>

</ul>

<h2 id="witnesses-of-fact">Witnesses of Fact</h2>

<ul>

      <li>An affidavit of evidence-in-chief should, as far as possible, be in the witnesses’ own words and should not contain legal or other arguments. It should identify which statements are made from the deponent’s own knowledge and which statements are based on information or belief, and if the latter, should identify the source or basis for the statement of information or belief.</li>
      <li>A witness giving oral evidence at trial may, with the permission of the Court and subject to any directions or limitations the Court may impose, be allowed to orally supplement his evidence in response to matters arising after the filing of affidavits of evidence-in-chief or in response to assertions by the other party or parties which the witness has not had a reasonable opportunity to respond to.</li>

  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Release of witness upon completion of evidence</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Every witness will be released from his oath by the Court upon completion of his evidence. If counsel does not wish for the witness to be released, it is his duty to apply to the Court and inform the Court of the reason for this application.</li>
    </ol>

Where applicable, the page number of the affidavit must correspond to the page number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version that is filed through the Electronic Filing Service.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Dividing sheets</em></p>

<ul>

<p>Subject to any orders made by the Court under Order 110, Rule 23 of the Rules of Court on the applicable rules of evidence, this Part shall apply to all trials and other hearings heard in the Court.</p>

<h2 id="opening-statements">Opening Statements</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>An opening statement is of great assistance to the Court as it sets out the case in a nutshell, both as to facts and law. It is intended to identify both for the parties and the Judge the issues that are, and are not, in dispute. It enables the Judge to appreciate what the case is about, and what he is to look out for when reading and listening to the evidence that will follow. The need for brevity is emphasised as opening statements that contain long and elaborate arguments, and citations from and references to numerous authorities, do not serve this purpose.
        <ol>
          <li>Opening statements will be required from all parties in all actions commenced by writ in the Court, except where dispensation has been granted by the Court.</li>
          <li>All opening statements must include the following:
            <ol>
              <li>the nature of the case generally and the background facts insofar as they are relevant to the matter before the Court and indicating which facts, if any, are agreed;</li>
              <li>the precise legal and factual issues involved are to be identified with cross-references as appropriate to the pleadings. These issues should be numbered and listed, and each point should be stated in no more than one or two sentences. The object here is to identify the issues in dispute and state each party’s position clearly, not to argue or elaborate on them;</li>
              <li>the principal authorities in support of each legal proposition should be listed, while the key documents and witnesses supporting each factual proposition should be identified;</li>
              <li>where there is a counterclaim or third party action, the opening statement must similarly address all issues raised therein; and</li>
              <li>an explanation of the reliefs claimed (if these are unusual or complicated).</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>In cases where the Court is of the opinion that costs or hearing days have been wasted by a poorly drafted opening statement, the Court may impose costs or other sanctions against the relevant person.</li>
          <li>The following format shall be adhered to when preparing opening statements:
            <ol>
              <li>all pages shall be paginated, with the first page (including the cover page) numbered as ‘Page 1’ so that the page numbers of the hard copy correspond to the page numbers in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version;</li>
              <li>the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent;</li>
              <li>the print of every page shall be double spaced;</li>
              <li>each page may be printed on one side or both sides; and</li>
              <li>every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35 mm in width.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>All opening statements should not exceed 20 pages (including all annexes and appendices, but excluding the cover page and backing page).</li>
          <li>Opening statements may be amended at trial, but counsel will be expected to explain the reasons for the amendments.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Subject to the Court’s directions, each party may supplement their opening statements with an oral address before the Court. These supplementary opening statements should be as brief as the circumstances allow and in any event, subject to the previously directed timetable at the Case Management Conference(s) or any other time limit as the Judge may allow.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="examination-and-cross-examination-of-witnesses">Examination and Cross-Examination of Witnesses</h2>

<p><em>General</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The examination, cross-examination, and re-examination of all witnesses shall be subject to the time limits set out in any previously directed timetable at the Case Management Conference or at the Pre-trial Review, or any other time limit as the trial Judge may allow. Counsel are expected to stay within those time limits.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Witnesses of fact</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Where a witness of fact has already deposed to an affidavit of evidence-in-chief, the examination of that witness should be confined to confirming the truth of that affidavit, correcting or clarifying any typographical or clerical errors in that affidavit, and where the Court has granted leave in accordance with paragraph 111(3) of these Practice Directions, clarifying or supplementing his evidence with oral testimony.</li>
      <li>Upon completion of evidence-in-chief, the witness will then be cross-examined. Where a witness is cross-examined by more than one party, the Court shall determine the order in which the other parties cross-examine the witnesses. Counsel are expected to comply with the rules of evidence found in Singapore law, whether under the Evidence Act (Cap. 97) or elsewhere, or other applicable evidential rules if any rule of evidence found in Singapore law has been disapplied pursuant to an order under Order 110, Rule 23 of the Rules of Court. Counsel are also expected to comply with all relevant ethical codes in the conduct of the cross-examination.</li>
      <li>Unless expressly allowed by the Court, once the witness commences cross-examination, the witness shall not be permitted to discuss his evidence with anyone, including any counsel, until that witness is released from his oath after re-examination.</li>
      <li>Upon completion of cross-examination(s), the witness shall be re-examined by the party who called the witness.</li>
      <li>The Court may, at any time, ask the witness questions. Where the questions elicit answers which parties have not previously dealt with, the Court shall allow parties a reasonable opportunity to direct questions to that witness on the answers given.</li>
      <li>The Court may, where appropriate, direct that cross-examination and re-examination be conducted on an issue by issue basis. The witness will be cross-examined and re-examined on the first issue, then cross-examined and re-examined on the second issue, and so on.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<h2 id="use-of-presentation-slides-for-trial-and-other-hearings-other-than-proceedings-before-the-court-of-appeal">Use of presentation slides for trial and other hearings (other than proceedings before the Court of Appeal)</h2>

<p>Subject to approval by the Court, parties may utilise presentation slides to assist in the conduct of trial and other hearings (other than proceedings before the Court of Appeal). Presentation slides may be projected in the courtroom or Chambers at the appropriate time (e.g. during oral submissions, in the course of examination of witnesses etc.). Presentation slides shall comply with the following standards:</p>

<p><em>Typeface</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>A clear typeface such as Arial or Times New Roman should be used; care should be taken to ensure that the font used is of at least a size equivalent to Arial font size 32. Bold and italicised fonts should be used sparingly.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Colours</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>There should be sufficient contrast between the slide background and text: it is preferable to use black or dark fonts with a light background. The colours used in slide backgrounds should be muted and preferably monochromatic.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Animation and sounds</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Animation of slides or elements within a slide should be avoided. Similarly, sounds should not be incorporated in the presentation slides unless they are necessary.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Corporate logos</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Corporate logos of the law practice may be displayed on the presentation slides. Care should be taken to ensure that the size and location of corporate logos do not distract from the substance of the presentation slides.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="closing-submissions">Closing Submissions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Unless otherwise directed, the Court will require written closing submissions from the parties.</li>
      <li>Written closing submissions will, unless the Court deems otherwise appropriate, be by way of an exchange of submissions, and unless otherwise directed, followed by reply submissions responding and confined to points raised in the other party’s initial closing submissions.</li>
      <li>After the written closing submissions have been filed and exchanged, the parties will be allowed to make oral submissions if so directed by the Court. The Court may impose time limits on the length of time each party is given for oral submission.</li>

    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Use of judgments as authorities in submissions</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyers or Registered Law Experts who cite a judgment must state the proposition of law that the judgment establishes and the parts of the judgment that support that proposition. Such statements should not excessively add to the length of the submissions but should be sufficient to demonstrate the relevance of that judgment to the argument made. Where the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyers or Registered Law Experts wish to cite more than two judgments as authority for a given proposition, there must be a compelling reason to do so, and this reason must be provided by the counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyers or Registered Law Experts in the submissions.</li>
      <li>The Court will also pay particular attention to any indication in the cited judgment that the judgment (i) only applied decided law to the facts of the particular case; or (ii) did not extend or add to the existing law.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Citation practice</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Counsel, Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyers or Registered Law Experts should, where possible, make specific citations by referring to the paragraph number of the judgment, and not to the page number of the judgment or report. For consistency, square brackets ([xx]) should be used to denote paragraph numbers.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Ancillary provisions</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The Court in exercising its discretion as to costs may, where appropriate in the circumstances, take into account the extent to which counsel, a Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or a Registered Law Expert has complied with this paragraph in the citation of judgments before the Court.</li>
      <li>It will remain the duty of counsel, a Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer or a Registered Law Expert to draw the attention of the Court to any judgment not cited by an opponent, which is adverse to the case being advanced.</li>
      <li>This paragraph applies to all hearings in the Court, both open Court and Chambers.</li>

<p>(6A) The indexes of the core bundle and supplemental core bundle shall correspond with the indexes of documents found in the form of core bundle and form of supplemental core bundle filed under paragraph 145(3) of these Practice Directions. Any document listed in the indexes should be suitably described in such a manner as to allow the Court to identify the nature of the document. Examples of suitable descriptions are set out below for reference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ol>
          <li>Joint Venture Agreement between Party A and Party B dated 1 December 2017;</li>
          <li>Minutes of meeting held on 1 December 2017 between Party A and Party B; and</li>
          <li>Email dated 1 December 2017 from Party A and Party B.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Parties should avoid the use of generic description such as “extracts from the affidavit of Party A filed on 1 December 2017” “or exhibits from the affidavit of Party A filed on 1 December 2017”.</p>

<p><em>Responsibility for good order and completeness of appeal records</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The counsel having the conduct of the appeal may delegate the preparation of the appeal records to an assistant or a suitably experienced law clerk or secretary, provided always that that counsel shall personally satisfy himself as to the good order and completeness of every copy of the appeal records lodged in Court in accordance with these Practice Directions, paragraph 148A included, and shall personally bear responsibility for any errors or deficiencies.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Superfluous, irrelevant and duplicate documents</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>With regard to the inclusion of documents, counsel’s attention is drawn to the provisions of Order 57, Rules 9(2), (2A), (3) as well as Order 57, Rules 9A(2A) and 5(C) of the Rules of Court. Only documents which are relevant to the subject matter of the appeal, or, in the case of Core Bundles and Supplemental Core Bundles, will be referred to in the Cases, shall be included in the appeal records.</li>
      <li>Parties are reminded not to exhibit duplicate documents in their Supplemental Core Bundle if such documents are already included in a Core Bundle or Supplemental Core Bundle that has been filed earlier. Documents shall not appear more than once in the records, even if exhibited to different affidavits.</li>
      <li>The Court of Appeal may impose costs or other sanctions in cases in which it is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of superfluous, irrelevant or duplicate documents.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="148a-inclusion-in-appeal-bundles-of-documents-ordered-to-be-sealed-or-redacted">148A. Inclusion in appeal bundles of documents ordered to be sealed or redacted</h2>

<p>(1) This paragraph applies only where certain documents tendered before the court below have been ordered to be sealed or redacted.</p>

<p>(2) Counsel should carefully consider whether it is necessary to include in the record of appeal, core bundle or supplemental core bundle (collectively known as “appeal bundles”) any document that has been ordered to be sealed or redacted, having regard to paragraph 148(8) of these Practice Directions.</p>

<p><em>Inclusion of redacted documents in appeal bundles</em></p>

<p>(3) Where it is necessary to include in the appeal bundles documents that have been ordered to be redacted, parties should do so by complying with the following directions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ol>
          <li>All documents subjected to a redaction order should not be included in the appeal bundles in their unredacted form. Instead, such documents should be included in the appeal bundles in their redacted form.</li>
          <li>In the margins against the redacted portions of the appeal bundles, the basis for the redaction should be stated (for example, “This information has been redacted pursuant to SIC/ORC 1/2017 made on 3 January 2017”).</li>
          <li>When tendering the appeal bundles, the parties should also tender a separate bundle, consisting only of documents subjected to a redaction order. These documents should be included in this bundle in their unredacted form (the “Bundle of Documents Subjected to Redaction Order” or “BDSRO”).</li>
          <li>The BDSRO should be tendered in both hard copies and soft copies. Where hard copies are concerned, parties should tender the number of copies as provided in paragraph 147(2) of these Practice Directions. Where soft copies are concerned, the BDSRO may be included in the CD-ROM mentioned in paragraph 147(3) of these Practice Directions and should be named in the format provided in paragraph 147(4) of these Practice Directions.</li>
          <li>The BDSRO should contain a table of contents. The format of the table of contents should comply with that provided in paragraph 148(4) of these Practice Directions.</li>
          <li>The pagination of the documents in the BDSRO should follow the pagination of the corresponding documents in the appeal bundles. Fresh pagination should not be assigned to the documents in the BDSRO.</li>
          <li>At the time when the parties tender the appeal bundles and the BDSRO, they should by way of a letter to the Legal Registry: (i) inform the Legal Registry that the BDSRO contains redacted information, (ii) specify the basis for the redaction; and (iii) request that the Legal Registry seal the BDSRO in the electronic case file and keep the hard copies from public inspection.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>(4) Counsel are reminded of their responsibility under paragraph 148(7) to personally satisfy themselves as to the good order of the appeal records. At the time the appeal bundles and BDSRO are tendered, the counsel having conduct of the appeal shall provide an undertaking to the Court that he has satisfied himself that the appeal bundles do not contain any document ordered to be redacted in its unredacted form. This undertaking shall be in Form 23 of Appendix B to these Practice Directions.</p>

<p><em>Inclusion of sealed documents in appeal bundles</em></p>

<p>(5) Where it is necessary to include in the appeal bundles documents that have been ordered to be sealed, parties should do so by complying with the following directions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All documents subjected to a sealing order should not be included in the appeal bundles. Instead, each and every such document should be represented in the appeal bundles by a separate holding page.</li>
  <li>Each and every holding page should be blank save that: (i) the basis for the sealing should be stated across each holding page (for example, “The affidavit of Tan filed on 30 December 2016 has been sealed pursuant to SIC/ORC 1/2017 made on 3 January 2017”); and (ii) the cross-references required under sub-paragraph (5)(f) should be indicated (for example, “Reference: BDSSO – Pages 1-10”).</li>
  <li>When tendering the appeal bundles, the parties should also tender a separate bundle, consisting only of documents subjected to a sealing order (the “Bundle of Documents Subjected to Sealing Order” or “BDSSO”).</li>
  <li>The BDSSO should be tendered both in hard copies and soft copies. Where hard copies are concerned, parties should tender the number of copies as is provided in paragraph 147(2) of these Practice Directions. Where soft copies are concerned, the BDSSO may be included in the CD-ROM mentioned in paragraph 147(3) of these Practice Directions and should be named in the format provided in paragraph 147(4) of these Practice Directions.</li>
  <li>The BDSSO should contain a table of contents. The format of the table of contents should comply with that provided in paragraph 148(4) of these Practice Directions.</li>
  <li>Given that each and every document subjected to a sealing order is represented only by a single holding page in the appeal bundles but is reproduced in full in the BDSSO, fresh pagination will have to be assigned to the pages in the BDSSO. Each holding page should contain cross-references to the pages of the BDSSO that the holding page represents (for example, “Reference: BDSSO – Pages 1-10”).</li>
  <li>At the time when the parties tender the appeal bundles and the BDSSO, they must by way of a letter to the Legal Registry: (i) inform the Legal Registry that the BDSSO contains documents ordered to be sealed, (ii) specify the basis for the sealing; and (iii) request that the Legal Registry seal the BDSSO in the electronic case file and keep the hard copies from public inspection.
    <ol>
      <li>Counsel are reminded of their responsibility under paragraph 148(7) to personally satisfy themselves as to the good order of the appeal records. At the time the appeal bundles and BDSSO are tendered, the solicitor having conduct of the appeal shall provide an undertaking to the Court that he has satisfied himself that the appeal bundles do not contain any document ordered to be sealed. This undertaking shall be in Form 23 of Appendix B to these Practice Directions.</li>
      <li>For the avoidance of doubt, documents that have been ordered to be expunged should not in any event be tendered to the Court of Appeal in any form.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="148b-bundle-of-documents-filed-with-leave-of-the-court-of-appeal">148B. Bundle of documents filed with leave of the Court of Appeal</h2>

<p>(1) Where leave is granted by the Court of Appeal for the filing of any bundle of documents under Order 57, Rule 9A(23) of the Rules of Court, the party shall file the bundle of documents by tendering the requisite hard copies of the bundle of documents to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 147(2) of these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(2) In addition to hard copies, the party filing the bundle of documents is required to tender soft copies of the bundle of documents in Portable Document Format (PDF) at the same time in a CD-ROM in accordance with paragraphs 147(3) and (4) of these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(3) The directions set out in paragraph 148 of these Practice Directions in relation to the preparation of the bundles shall, with the necessary modifications, apply to the bundle of documents.</p>

<h2 id="skeletal-arguments-for-appeals-before-the-court-of-appeal">Skeletal arguments for appeals before the Court of Appeal</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>This paragraph applies to civil appeals and any other civil matters before the Court of Appeal.</li>
      <li>The term “skeletal arguments” includes “skeletal submissions”, “written submissions”, “written arguments” and all other variant terms by which such documents are known.</li>
      <li>Counsel should submit skeletal arguments for the hearing of the appeal or matter and give a copy to counsel for the other parties. Hard copies of skeletal arguments may be printed on one side or both sides of each page.</li>
      <li>Skeletal arguments are abbreviated notes of the arguments that will be presented. Skeletal arguments are not formal documents and do not bind parties. They are a valuable tool to the Judges and are meant to expedite the hearing of the appeal. These notes should comply with the following requirements:
        <ol>
          <li>they should contain a numbered list of the points proposed to be argued, stated in no more than one or 2 sentences;</li>
          <li>each listed point should be accompanied by a full reference to the material to which counsel will be referring, i.e., the relevant pages or passages in authorities, the record of appeal, the bundles of documents, affidavits, transcripts and the judgment under appeal;</li>
          <li>all pages should be paginated, with the first page (not including any cover page) numbered as “Page 1”;</li>
          <li>the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent;</li>
          <li>the print of every page shall be double-spaced; and</li>
          <li>every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35mm in width.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The need for parties to avoid prolixity in their skeletal arguments is emphasised. All skeletal arguments in civil matters before the Court of Appeal shall not exceed 20 pages. Any skeletal arguments in breach of this requirement will be rejected. The cover page and backing page shall be excluded from any computation of the number of pages.</li>
      <li>Where the appeal or matter is before the Court of Appeal, the skeletal arguments must be filed by 4 p.m. on the Monday three weeks before the start of the Court of Appeal sitting period within which that appeal or matter is scheduled for hearing, regardless of the actual day (within that sitting period) on which that appeal or matter is scheduled for hearing before the Court of Appeal. (For example, if the sitting period starts on Monday, 18 February 2019 and ends on Friday, 8 March 2019, all skeletal arguments for appeals or matters listed before the Court of Appeal in that sitting period must be filed by 4 p.m. on Monday, 28 January 2019.). The skeletal arguments should be filed by tendering hard copies to the SICC Registry and filing, serving, delivering or otherwise conveying to the SICC Registry one soft copy in accordance with paragraph 44, 45 or 46 of these Practice Directions). Skeletal arguments filed in breach of this timeline will be rejected.</li>
      <li>In relation to the hard copies referred to at sub-paragraph (6):
        <ol>
          <li>Where the appeal is to be heard by a 2-judge Court, 3 hard copies should be tendered;</li>
          <li>Where the appeal is to be heard by a 3-judge Court, 4 hard copies should be tendered; and</li>
          <li>Where the appeal is to be heard by a 5-judge Court, 6 hard copies should be tendered.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Parties whose skeletal arguments have been rejected for filing may re-file their skeletal arguments, provided they comply with sub-paragraphs (4) to (6) above.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Further skeletal arguments for civil matters before the Court of Appeal</em></strong></p>

<p>(8A) Where the Court of Appeal orders further skeletal arguments (including any submissions on costs) to be filed for any civil matter, such skeletal arguments shall not exceed 10 pages unless otherwise directed by the Court of Appeal. Any skeletal arguments filed in breach of this requirement will be rejected. The cover page and backing page shall be excluded from any computation of the number of pages.</p>

<h2 id="149a-costs-scheduling">149A. Costs scheduling</h2>

<p>(1) Each party to the appeal shall be required to file a costs schedule using Form 24 in Appendix B of these Practice Directions. The costs schedule should set out with sufficient particularity the quantum of party-and-party costs and disbursements that the party intends to claim in the event that the party succeeds.</p>

<p>(2) The relevant costs schedule will be taken into account for the purpose of assessing the quantum of costs to be awarded for the appeal.</p>

<p>(3) The costs schedule for the proceedings shall be filed together with the parties’ skeletal arguments.</p>

<h2 id="further-arguments-before-the-court-of-appeal">Further arguments before the Court of Appeal</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>From time to time, requests are received for further arguments to be presented before the Court of Appeal after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal. Such requests should not be made as all relevant arguments should have been presented at the hearing proper.</li>
      <li>As a general rule, unless asked for by the Court of Appeal itself, the Court of Appeal will not receive further arguments after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal.</li>
      <li>The general rule will be relaxed in only very exceptional circumstances, for example, if an authority not available at the hearing would be decisive. Counsel seeking to submit further arguments should therefore satisfy themselves that very exceptional circumstances exist. If they are of the view that such circumstances do exist, they must also seek the consent of the other parties to their request.</li>
      <li>All requests for further arguments shall be made by submitting a request to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions and should:
        <ol>
          <li>state the party making the requests;</li>
          <li>identify the Judges constituting the Court of Appeal who heard the matter in question;</li>
          <li>specify when the order concerned was made;</li>
          <li>state the very exceptional reasons which justify the request;</li>
          <li>state whether the other parties consent to the request;</li>
          <li>set out the proposed further arguments briefly, together with any authorities; and</li>
          <li>include a copy of each of the authorities cited.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Any request for further arguments must be received by the Registrar within one week after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, failing which it cannot be considered and will be rejected.</li>
      <li>A copy of the request should be furnished to all parties concerned.</li>
      <li>All requests should be addressed to the Registrar.</li>

      <li>The costs of and incidental to any application or proceedings shall be in the discretion of the Court and the Court shall have the full power to determine by whom and to what extent the costs are to be paid.</li>
      <li>In assessing costs, the Court:
        <ol>
          <li>shall have regard to Order 110, Rule 46(1) of the Rules of Court, which provides that the reasonable costs of any application or proceeding in the SICC be borne by the unsuccessful party to that application or proceeding unless the Court orders otherwise; and</li>
          <li>may, in particular, as set out in Order 110, Rule 46(1):
            <ol>
              <li>apportion costs between the parties if the Court determines that the apportionment is reasonable, taking into account the circumstances of the case;</li>
              <li>take into account such circumstances as the Court considers relevant, including the conduct of the case;</li>
              <li>order costs to be paid by counsel, a Restricted Registration Foreign Lawyer, or a Registered Law Expert personally, or by a person who is not a party to the application or proceeding;</li>

      <li>In relation to sub-paragraph (2)(b)(ii) above, the circumstances which the Court may take into consideration in ordering reasonable costs of any application or proceeding under Order 110, Rule 46(1) of the Rules of Court include:

In particular, the Court may require parties to provide a costs schedule to be submitted with closing submissions, or to submit cost estimates or budgets in the course of the proceedings. A sample costs schedule is set out in Form 24 of Appendix B to these Practice Directions.</li>
      <li>The Court may take into account any payment of money into court or offer to settle and the conduct of the parties in relation to that payment into court or offer to settle.</li>
