# Part XI - SERVICE

## Personal service of processes and documents

*   1.  Subject to the provisions of any written law and the Rules of Court, all originating processes must be served personally on each defendant. The provisions of Order 10 and Order 62 of the Rules of Court in relation to personal service of documents shall apply in this regard.
    2.  The attention of counsel is drawn to Order 62, Rule 2(1) of the Rules of Court which provides:

“Personal service must be effected by a process server of the Supreme Court or by a solicitor or **a solicitor’s clerk whose name and particulars have been notified to the Registrar for this purpose**:

Provided that the Registrar may, in a particular cause or matter, allow personal service to be effected by any other named person and shall, in that case, cause to be marked on the document required to be served personally, a memorandum to that effect.” \[Emphasis added.\]

*   1.  Counsel are required to notify the SICC Registry of the particulars of such clerks who have been authorised by them to serve processes and documents (“authorised process servers”) by submitting a request to authorise user in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. Counsel’s clerks do not require the authorisation of the Registrar to effect personal service of processes and documents.
    2.  As personal service can be effected by counsel or counsel’s clerks, Court process servers will not be assigned to effect personal service of processes and documents unless there are special reasons.
    3.  If there are special reasons requiring personal service by a Court process server, a request for such service should be submitted to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions, setting out the special reasons. The approval of the Duty Registrar should then be obtained for such service. Once approval has been obtained, a process server will be assigned to effect service and an appointment for service convenient to both the litigant and the assigned process server will be given.
    4.  On the appointed date, the person accompanying the Court process server should call at the SICC Registry. The amount required for the transport charges of the Court process server (a record of which will be kept) should be tendered. Alternatively, the SICC Registry should be informed beforehand that transport for the Court process server will be provided. The SICC Registry will then instruct the Court process server to effect service.
    5.  Under no circumstances should any payment be made directly to the Court process server.

## Service out of jurisdiction

*   1.  Where an originating process, summons, notice or order issued, given or made in any proceedings to which Order 110 of the Rules of Court applies is to be served outside of Singapore, leave under Order 11, Rules 1, 8 or Order 69A, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court is not required if service is on a party to a written jurisdiction agreement. In all other circumstances, leave for service out of jurisdiction should be obtained under Order 11 or Order 69A, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court.
    2.  An application for leave to serve an originating process outside of Singapore shall be made in the manner set out in Order 11, Rule 2(1) or Order 69A, Rule 4 of the Rules of Court. The Court shall not grant leave unless it shall be made sufficiently appear to the Court that the case is a proper one for service out of Singapore.
    3.  The modes by which service of an originating process may be made out of jurisdiction are set out in Order 11, Rules 3 to 7 of the Rules of Court.

## Substituted service

*   1.  The provisions of Order 62, Rule 5 of the Rules of Court shall apply with regard to the substituted service of documents in cases where it appears to the Court that personal service of such documents is impractical.
    2.  An application for an order for substituted service shall be made in the manner set out in Order 62, Rule 5(2) of the Rules of Court. The Court shall, on any such application, have the discretion to authorise the service of documents in such manner as the Court is satisfied will probably be effectual in bringing such documents to the notice of the person to be served.
    3.  In any application for substituted service, the applicant should persuade the Court that the proposed mode of substituted service will probably be effectual in bringing the document in question to the notice of the person to be served.
    4.  Two reasonable attempts at personal service should be made before an application for an order for substituted service is filed. In an application for substituted service, the applicant shall demonstrate by way of affidavit why he believes that the attempts at service made were reasonable.
    5.  The applicant should, where appropriate, also consider other modes of substituted service, such as AR registered post or electronic means (including electronic mail or Internet transmission) in addition to or in substitution of substituted service by posting on doors or gates of residential and business premises.
    6.  An application for substituted service by posting at an address or by AR registered post should contain evidence (for example, relevant search results from the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, the Singapore Land Authority, the Housing & Development Board or the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority) that the person to be served is resident or can be located at the property.
    7.  For the avoidance of doubt, substituted service by AR registered post is deemed to be effected when the postal service has delivered the document, or attempted to deliver the document (in cases where no one is present or willing to accept the document).
    8.  If substituted service is by electronic mail, it has to be shown that the electronic mail account to which the document will be sent belongs to the person to be served and that it is currently active.
    9.  An application for substituted service by advertisement should only be considered as a last resort and should contain evidence that the person to be served is literate in the language of the newspaper in which the advertisement will be placed.
    10.  The Court shall, in the exercise of its discretion referred to in sub-paragraph (2) above, give directions as to the manner in which the mode of service is to be effected, including (without limitation):
        1.  The content of any notice that must accompany the document to be served, explaining the nature of the document to be served, the steps that the Recipient must take upon receipt of the document and the possible consequences should the Recipient not take any action; and
        2.  The filing of an affidavit of service by the party effecting service of the document confirming that the directions of the Court have been adhered to.

## Ordinary service of documents

*   1.  Order 62, Rule 6 of the Rules of Court shall apply in relation to the service of documents other than those required to be served personally pursuant to any provision in the Rules of Court.
    2.  For the purposes of Order 62, Rule 6(1)(e), and without limiting the scope of Order 62, Rule 6(4) of the Rules of Court, the manner in which the Court may direct service of any document to be effected shall include by way of courier, e-mail and social media.

## General

*   1.  Where any document is served before midnight on any particular day, it shall be deemed to have been served on that day.
    2.  Where the service of any document is effected before 4:00 p.m. on a working day, it shall, for the purpose of computing any period of time after service of that document, be deemed to have been served on that working day and, in any other case, on the next working day.
    3.  For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these directions shall be construed as prescribing the hours within which service must be effected in order to be valid.
    4.  An affidavit of service of any document must be in Form 138 of the Rules of Court and must state by whom the document was served, the day of the week and date on which it was served, where it was served and how.
    5.  Where any document is required to be served on any person but is not required to be served personally, and at the time when service is to be effected that person is in default as to entry of appearance or has no address for service, then that document need not be served on that person unless otherwise provided in the Rules of Court or directed by the Court.
    6.  The Court may, in an appropriate case, dispense with service of any document on any person.
