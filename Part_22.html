<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>This sub-paragraph sets out the manner of arranging the Record of Appeal.

          <li>To facilitate cross-referencing, the Record of Appeal shall be arranged in the following separate volumes:
            <ol>
              <li>Volume I – Judgment or grounds of decision and the engrossed order of Court of judgment appealed from.</li>
              <li>Volume II – Notice of appeal, certificate of security for costs and pleadings (to include all originating processes).</li>
              <li>Volume III – Affidavits (in chronological order), and transcripts or notes of evidence and arguments.</li>

              <li>Volume V – The Agreed Bundle (if any) in its original physical form as it was tendered in the Court below.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Where there are no exhibits or documents referred to in sub-paragraph (2)(a)(iv) above, Volume IV need not be produced, and Volume V shall be renumbered as Volume IV.</li>
          <li>If any volume exceeds 300 pages, then that volume shall be sub-divided, at a convenient page, into sub-volumes designated as part thereof, for example, Volume III Part A, Volume III Part B and so on. Conversely, if any of the volumes (with the exception of Volumes I and II which shall remain as separate volumes) should be less than 100 pages each, these may be amalgamated into combined volumes, each not exceeding 300 pages, and renumbered accordingly.</li>
          <li>The following additional directions shall apply to the form of the Record of Appeal:

              <li>The documentary exhibits in Volume IV shall be arranged in the most convenient way for the use of the Court, as the circumstances of the case require. The documents shall, as far as suitable, be arranged in chronological order, mixing plaintiff’s and defendant’s documents together when necessary (for example, in a series of correspondence). If proceedings in a suit other than the one under appeal appear as exhibits, then these shall be kept together. However, the documents from each suit shall be arranged in the chronological order of the suits.</li>
              <li>Each document in Volume IV shall show its exhibit mark and whether it is the plaintiff’s or the defendant’s document, unless this is clear from the mark.</li>

          <li>The page number of each volume of the appeal records must correspond to the page number in the Portable Document Format (PDF) version of that volume. Each separate volume of the appeal records shall start at page 1 and every page shall be numbered consecutively. If separator sheets are used, these shall also be numbered.</li>

          <li>Electronic bookmarks for each item of the table of contents and sub-table of contents must be added to each volume of the PDF version of the appeal records. The description of each bookmark shall correspond with the description of that item in the table of contents or sub-table of contents, unless an abbreviated description is appropriate.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>

<p><em>Spacing</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The line spacing on every page of the records of which the original is<br />
type-written (e.g., notice of appeal) shall be double-spaced.</li>

<p><em>Core bundles – Order 57, Rule 9(2A) of the Rules of Court</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The documents to be included in the core bundle are stipulated in Order 57, Rule 9(2A) of the Rules of Court. The contents of the core bundle shall be arranged in the following separate volumes:
        <ol>
          <li>Volume I – a copy of the grounds of the judgment or order, the judgment or order appealed from and an index of the documents included therein.</li>
          <li>Volume II – all other documents referred to in Order 57, Rule 9(2A), and an index of the documents included therein.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Each volume of the core bundle shall begin at page 1, every page shall be numbered and the page number of the core bundle shall correspond to the page number of the Portable Document Format (PDF) version.</p>

<p>(6A) The indexes of the core bundle and supplemental core bundle shall correspond with the indexes of documents found in the form of core bundle and form of supplemental core bundle filed under paragraph 145(3) of these Practice Directions. Any document listed in the indexes should be suitably described in such a manner as to allow the Court to identify the nature of the document. Examples of suitable descriptions are set out below for reference:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ol>
          <li>Joint Venture Agreement between Party A and Party B dated 1 December 2017;</li>
          <li>Minutes of meeting held on 1 December 2017 between Party A and Party B; and</li>
          <li>Email dated 1 December 2017 from Party A and Party B.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Parties should avoid the use of generic description such as “extracts from the affidavit of Party A filed on 1 December 2017” “or exhibits from the affidavit of Party A filed on 1 December 2017”.</p>

<p><em>Responsibility for good order and completeness of appeal records</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The counsel having the conduct of the appeal may delegate the preparation of the appeal records to an assistant or a suitably experienced law clerk or secretary, provided always that that counsel shall personally satisfy himself as to the good order and completeness of every copy of the appeal records lodged in Court in accordance with these Practice Directions, paragraph 148A included, and shall personally bear responsibility for any errors or deficiencies.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Superfluous, irrelevant and duplicate documents</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>With regard to the inclusion of documents, counsel’s attention is drawn to the provisions of Order 57, Rules 9(2), (2A), (3) as well as Order 57, Rules 9A(2A) and 5(C) of the Rules of Court. Only documents which are relevant to the subject matter of the appeal, or, in the case of Core Bundles and Supplemental Core Bundles, will be referred to in the Cases, shall be included in the appeal records.</li>
      <li>Parties are reminded not to exhibit duplicate documents in their Supplemental Core Bundle if such documents are already included in a Core Bundle or Supplemental Core Bundle that has been filed earlier. Documents shall not appear more than once in the records, even if exhibited to different affidavits.</li>
      <li>The Court of Appeal may impose costs or other sanctions in cases in which it is of the opinion that costs have been wasted by the inclusion of superfluous, irrelevant or duplicate documents.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="148a-inclusion-in-appeal-bundles-of-documents-ordered-to-be-sealed-or-redacted">148A. Inclusion in appeal bundles of documents ordered to be sealed or redacted</h2>

<p>(1) This paragraph applies only where certain documents tendered before the court below have been ordered to be sealed or redacted.</p>

<p>(2) Counsel should carefully consider whether it is necessary to include in the record of appeal, core bundle or supplemental core bundle (collectively known as “appeal bundles”) any document that has been ordered to be sealed or redacted, having regard to paragraph 148(8) of these Practice Directions.</p>

<p><em>Inclusion of redacted documents in appeal bundles</em></p>

<p>(3) Where it is necessary to include in the appeal bundles documents that have been ordered to be redacted, parties should do so by complying with the following directions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ol>
          <li>All documents subjected to a redaction order should not be included in the appeal bundles in their unredacted form. Instead, such documents should be included in the appeal bundles in their redacted form.</li>
          <li>In the margins against the redacted portions of the appeal bundles, the basis for the redaction should be stated (for example, “This information has been redacted pursuant to SIC/ORC 1/2017 made on 3 January 2017”).</li>
          <li>When tendering the appeal bundles, the parties should also tender a separate bundle, consisting only of documents subjected to a redaction order. These documents should be included in this bundle in their unredacted form (the “Bundle of Documents Subjected to Redaction Order” or “BDSRO”).</li>
          <li>The BDSRO should be tendered in both hard copies and soft copies. Where hard copies are concerned, parties should tender the number of copies as provided in paragraph 147(2) of these Practice Directions. Where soft copies are concerned, the BDSRO may be included in the CD-ROM mentioned in paragraph 147(3) of these Practice Directions and should be named in the format provided in paragraph 147(4) of these Practice Directions.</li>
          <li>The BDSRO should contain a table of contents. The format of the table of contents should comply with that provided in paragraph 148(4) of these Practice Directions.</li>
          <li>The pagination of the documents in the BDSRO should follow the pagination of the corresponding documents in the appeal bundles. Fresh pagination should not be assigned to the documents in the BDSRO.</li>
          <li>At the time when the parties tender the appeal bundles and the BDSRO, they should by way of a letter to the Legal Registry: (i) inform the Legal Registry that the BDSRO contains redacted information, (ii) specify the basis for the redaction; and (iii) request that the Legal Registry seal the BDSRO in the electronic case file and keep the hard copies from public inspection.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>(4) Counsel are reminded of their responsibility under paragraph 148(7) to personally satisfy themselves as to the good order of the appeal records. At the time the appeal bundles and BDSRO are tendered, the counsel having conduct of the appeal shall provide an undertaking to the Court that he has satisfied himself that the appeal bundles do not contain any document ordered to be redacted in its unredacted form. This undertaking shall be in Form 23 of Appendix B to these Practice Directions.</p>

<p><em>Inclusion of sealed documents in appeal bundles</em></p>

<p>(5) Where it is necessary to include in the appeal bundles documents that have been ordered to be sealed, parties should do so by complying with the following directions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>All documents subjected to a sealing order should not be included in the appeal bundles. Instead, each and every such document should be represented in the appeal bundles by a separate holding page.</li>
  <li>Each and every holding page should be blank save that: (i) the basis for the sealing should be stated across each holding page (for example, “The affidavit of Tan filed on 30 December 2016 has been sealed pursuant to SIC/ORC 1/2017 made on 3 January 2017”); and (ii) the cross-references required under sub-paragraph (5)(f) should be indicated (for example, “Reference: BDSSO – Pages 1-10”).</li>
  <li>When tendering the appeal bundles, the parties should also tender a separate bundle, consisting only of documents subjected to a sealing order (the “Bundle of Documents Subjected to Sealing Order” or “BDSSO”).</li>
  <li>The BDSSO should be tendered both in hard copies and soft copies. Where hard copies are concerned, parties should tender the number of copies as is provided in paragraph 147(2) of these Practice Directions. Where soft copies are concerned, the BDSSO may be included in the CD-ROM mentioned in paragraph 147(3) of these Practice Directions and should be named in the format provided in paragraph 147(4) of these Practice Directions.</li>
  <li>The BDSSO should contain a table of contents. The format of the table of contents should comply with that provided in paragraph 148(4) of these Practice Directions.</li>
  <li>Given that each and every document subjected to a sealing order is represented only by a single holding page in the appeal bundles but is reproduced in full in the BDSSO, fresh pagination will have to be assigned to the pages in the BDSSO. Each holding page should contain cross-references to the pages of the BDSSO that the holding page represents (for example, “Reference: BDSSO – Pages 1-10”).</li>
  <li>At the time when the parties tender the appeal bundles and the BDSSO, they must by way of a letter to the Legal Registry: (i) inform the Legal Registry that the BDSSO contains documents ordered to be sealed, (ii) specify the basis for the sealing; and (iii) request that the Legal Registry seal the BDSSO in the electronic case file and keep the hard copies from public inspection.
    <ol>
      <li>Counsel are reminded of their responsibility under paragraph 148(7) to personally satisfy themselves as to the good order of the appeal records. At the time the appeal bundles and BDSSO are tendered, the solicitor having conduct of the appeal shall provide an undertaking to the Court that he has satisfied himself that the appeal bundles do not contain any document ordered to be sealed. This undertaking shall be in Form 23 of Appendix B to these Practice Directions.</li>
      <li>For the avoidance of doubt, documents that have been ordered to be expunged should not in any event be tendered to the Court of Appeal in any form.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="148b-bundle-of-documents-filed-with-leave-of-the-court-of-appeal">148B. Bundle of documents filed with leave of the Court of Appeal</h2>

<p>(1) Where leave is granted by the Court of Appeal for the filing of any bundle of documents under Order 57, Rule 9A(23) of the Rules of Court, the party shall file the bundle of documents by tendering the requisite hard copies of the bundle of documents to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 147(2) of these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(2) In addition to hard copies, the party filing the bundle of documents is required to tender soft copies of the bundle of documents in Portable Document Format (PDF) at the same time in a CD-ROM in accordance with paragraphs 147(3) and (4) of these Practice Directions.</p>

<p>(3) The directions set out in paragraph 148 of these Practice Directions in relation to the preparation of the bundles shall, with the necessary modifications, apply to the bundle of documents.</p>

<h2 id="skeletal-arguments-for-appeals-before-the-court-of-appeal">Skeletal arguments for appeals before the Court of Appeal</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>This paragraph applies to civil appeals and any other civil matters before the Court of Appeal.</li>
      <li>The term “skeletal arguments” includes “skeletal submissions”, “written submissions”, “written arguments” and all other variant terms by which such documents are known.</li>
      <li>Counsel should submit skeletal arguments for the hearing of the appeal or matter and give a copy to counsel for the other parties. Hard copies of skeletal arguments may be printed on one side or both sides of each page.</li>
      <li>Skeletal arguments are abbreviated notes of the arguments that will be presented. Skeletal arguments are not formal documents and do not bind parties. They are a valuable tool to the Judges and are meant to expedite the hearing of the appeal. These notes should comply with the following requirements:
        <ol>
          <li>they should contain a numbered list of the points proposed to be argued, stated in no more than one or 2 sentences;</li>
          <li>each listed point should be accompanied by a full reference to the material to which counsel will be referring, i.e., the relevant pages or passages in authorities, the record of appeal, the bundles of documents, affidavits, transcripts and the judgment under appeal;</li>
          <li>all pages should be paginated, with the first page (not including any cover page) numbered as “Page 1”;</li>
          <li>the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent;</li>
          <li>the print of every page shall be double-spaced; and</li>
          <li>every page shall have a margin on all 4 sides, each of at least 35mm in width.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The need for parties to avoid prolixity in their skeletal arguments is emphasised. All skeletal arguments in civil matters before the Court of Appeal shall not exceed 20 pages. Any skeletal arguments in breach of this requirement will be rejected. The cover page and backing page shall be excluded from any computation of the number of pages.</li>
      <li>Where the appeal or matter is before the Court of Appeal, the skeletal arguments must be filed by 4 p.m. on the Monday three weeks before the start of the Court of Appeal sitting period within which that appeal or matter is scheduled for hearing, regardless of the actual day (within that sitting period) on which that appeal or matter is scheduled for hearing before the Court of Appeal. (For example, if the sitting period starts on Monday, 18 February 2019 and ends on Friday, 8 March 2019, all skeletal arguments for appeals or matters listed before the Court of Appeal in that sitting period must be filed by 4 p.m. on Monday, 28 January 2019.). The skeletal arguments should be filed by tendering hard copies to the SICC Registry and filing, serving, delivering or otherwise conveying to the SICC Registry one soft copy in accordance with paragraph 44, 45 or 46 of these Practice Directions). Skeletal arguments filed in breach of this timeline will be rejected.</li>
      <li>In relation to the hard copies referred to at sub-paragraph (6):
        <ol>
          <li>Where the appeal is to be heard by a 2-judge Court, 3 hard copies should be tendered;</li>
          <li>Where the appeal is to be heard by a 3-judge Court, 4 hard copies should be tendered; and</li>
          <li>Where the appeal is to be heard by a 5-judge Court, 6 hard copies should be tendered.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Parties whose skeletal arguments have been rejected for filing may re-file their skeletal arguments, provided they comply with sub-paragraphs (4) to (6) above.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Further skeletal arguments for civil matters before the Court of Appeal</em></strong></p>

<p>(8A) Where the Court of Appeal orders further skeletal arguments (including any submissions on costs) to be filed for any civil matter, such skeletal arguments shall not exceed 10 pages unless otherwise directed by the Court of Appeal. Any skeletal arguments filed in breach of this requirement will be rejected. The cover page and backing page shall be excluded from any computation of the number of pages.</p>

<h2 id="149a-costs-scheduling">149A. Costs scheduling</h2>

<p>(1) Each party to the appeal shall be required to file a costs schedule using Form 24 in Appendix B of these Practice Directions. The costs schedule should set out with sufficient particularity the quantum of party-and-party costs and disbursements that the party intends to claim in the event that the party succeeds.</p>

<p>(2) The relevant costs schedule will be taken into account for the purpose of assessing the quantum of costs to be awarded for the appeal.</p>

<p>(3) The costs schedule for the proceedings shall be filed together with the parties’ skeletal arguments.</p>

                  <li>Unless otherwise provided by any written law or otherwise directed, reply affidavits (if any) for applications before the Court of Appeal are to be filed and served within 7 days after the date the application and the affidavit in support of the application (if any) are served on the party.</li>

                  <li>Unless otherwise provided by any written law or unless otherwise directed, parties are to file and serve submissions (if any) in respect of the application before the Court of Appeal within 7 days after the date the reply affidavit is due for filing and service.</li>

<p>the minimum font size to be used is Times New Roman 12 or its equivalent;</p>

                  <li>If no affidavits or submissions are filed by the timelines prescribed by this paragraph, the Court of Appeal will proceed on the basis that the party does not intend to file any affidavit or submissions and may decide the matter based on the documents before it without hearing oral arguments.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>

<h2 id="use-of-presentation-slides-for-all-proceedings-before-the-court-of-appeal">Use of presentation slides for all proceedings before the Court of Appeal</h2>

<p>Subject to approval by the Court of Appeal, paragraph 121 of these Practice Directions on the use of presentation slides for trial shall apply to proceedings before the Court of Appeal.</p>

<h2 id="further-arguments-before-the-court-of-appeal">Further arguments before the Court of Appeal</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>From time to time, requests are received for further arguments to be presented before the Court of Appeal after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal. Such requests should not be made as all relevant arguments should have been presented at the hearing proper.</li>
      <li>As a general rule, unless asked for by the Court of Appeal itself, the Court of Appeal will not receive further arguments after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal.</li>
      <li>The general rule will be relaxed in only very exceptional circumstances, for example, if an authority not available at the hearing would be decisive. Counsel seeking to submit further arguments should therefore satisfy themselves that very exceptional circumstances exist. If they are of the view that such circumstances do exist, they must also seek the consent of the other parties to their request.</li>
      <li>All requests for further arguments shall be made by submitting a request to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions and should:
        <ol>
          <li>state the party making the requests;</li>
          <li>identify the Judges constituting the Court of Appeal who heard the matter in question;</li>
          <li>specify when the order concerned was made;</li>
          <li>state the very exceptional reasons which justify the request;</li>
          <li>state whether the other parties consent to the request;</li>
          <li>set out the proposed further arguments briefly, together with any authorities; and</li>
          <li>include a copy of each of the authorities cited.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Any request for further arguments must be received by the Registrar within one week after the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal, failing which it cannot be considered and will be rejected.</li>
      <li>A copy of the request should be furnished to all parties concerned.</li>
      <li>All requests should be addressed to the Registrar.</li>
