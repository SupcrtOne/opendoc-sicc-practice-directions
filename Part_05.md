# Part V - OFFSHORE CASES

## General

*   1.  Pursuant to Order 110, Rule 34 of the Rules of Court, an action is treated as an offshore case in any of the following circumstances, unless the Court subsequently decides that the action is not or is no longer an offshore case:
        1.  a party has filed an offshore case declaration in Form 4 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions;
        2.  the Court decides under Order 110, Rule 36 of the Rules of Court that the action is an offshore case.

_Illustrations of when the “subject-matter of the dispute” is regulated by or otherwise subject to Singapore law_

*   1.  The illustrations set out in this sub-paragraph are intended to demonstrate, as a matter of general principle, cases where the subject-matter of the dispute is regulated by or otherwise subject to Singapore law for the purposes of Order 110, Rule 1(2)(f)(i) of the Rules of Court. Such cases would, consequently, fall outside the scope of offshore cases:
        1.  where there is a dispute over the sale of shares in a Singapore incorporated company pursuant to a share purchase agreement governed by New York law, the subject-matter of the dispute (i.e. the shares) is regulated by or otherwise subject to Singapore law;
        2.  where there is a dispute over the transfer of land in Singapore pursuant to a contract governed by English law, the subject-matter of the dispute (i.e. the land) is regulated by or otherwise subject to Singapore law; and
        3.  where there is a dispute over the affairs of a company pursuant to a shareholders’ agreement governed by Indonesian law and one of the issues relates to the use of a patent registered in Singapore, the subject-matter of the dispute (i.e. the patent) is regulated by or otherwise subject to Singapore law.

_“Substantial connection to Singapore”_

*   1.  For the purposes of Order 110, Rule 1(2)(f)(ii) of the Rules of Court, the existence of each of the following factors will not, by itself, constitute a substantial connection between the dispute and Singapore:
        1.  any of the witnesses in the case may be found in Singapore;
        2.  any of the documents that are relevant to the dispute may be located in Singapore;
        3.  funds connected with the dispute have passed through Singapore or are located in bank accounts in Singapore;
        4.  one of the parties to the dispute has properties or assets in Singapore that are not the subject matter of the dispute;
        5.  where one of the parties is a Singapore party, or where a party is not a Singapore party, but has Singapore shareholders.

_“Action in rem”_

*   1.  For the purposes of the definition of an “offshore case” under Order 110, Rule 1(1) of the Rules of Court, an _action in rem_ (against a ship or any other property) under the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act (Cap. 123) shall not be considered an offshore case.

“_Proceedings under the International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A)”_

(5) For the purposes of the definition of an “offshore case” under Order 110, Rule 1(1) of the Rules of Court, any proceedings under the International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A) that are commenced by way of any originating process shall not be considered an offshore case.
