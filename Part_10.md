## Proceedings commenced by Originating Summons

    2.  Pursuant to Order 12, Rule 9 of the Rules of Court, no appearance needs to be entered for an originating summons.

_Ex parte Originating Summonses_

*   1.  In all cases where a party approaches the Court on an _ex parte_ basis, that party must consider its duty to make full and frank disclosure to the Court and the potential consequences of material non-disclosure. Parties should also bear in mind their continuing duty to make full and frank disclosure of all disclosable matters that arise or occur to the party after the grant of _ex parte_ relief.
    2.  When an _ex parte_ originating summons is filed, the affidavit(s) in support of the application should be filed together with the _ex parte_ originating summons.

    2.  Where parties agree that a case should proceed on an expedited basis, they may, in accordance with paragraph 75(2)(c) of these Practice Directions, apply to the Court to fix a Case Management Conference for the purposes of obtaining directions for expedited timelines.

## Identification numbers to be stated in cause papers

_Parties named in the title of the documents_

*   1.  Where a party to any proceedings in the Court first files a document in such proceedings, he shall state his identification number (in brackets) in the title of the document immediately after his name. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number in the title of the documents.

_Parties not named in the title of the documents_

*   1.  Where a party to any proceedings in the Court first files a document in such proceedings, and the name of the party does not appear in the title of the document but does appear in the body of the document, then the identification number of the party should be stated (in brackets) after the first appearance of his name in the document. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number (in brackets) after the first appearance of the party’s name.

_Documents filed by 2 or more parties_

*   1.  Sub-paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply, _mutatis mutandis_, to documents which are filed by more than one party.

_Identification numbers for non-parties_

*   1.  If any person (living or dead), any entity or any property is the subject matter of any proceedings, or is affected by any proceedings, but is not a party thereto, and the name of such person, entity or property is to appear in the title of the documents filed in the proceedings, the party filing the first document in the proceedings must state the identification number of such person, entity or property (in brackets) immediately after the name of the same. Thereafter, all documents subsequently filed in the proceedings by any party shall include this identification number (in brackets) immediately after the name of the person, entity or property to which it applies. If the party filing the first document in the proceedings is unable, after reasonable enquiry, to discover the identification number of the person, entity or property, he may state immediately after the name of the same “(ID No. not known)”. All documents subsequently filed by any party shall then contain these words (in brackets) after the name of this person, entity or property.

_Special cases_

*   1.  The following directions shall apply in addition to the directions contained in sub-paragraphs (1) to (4):
        1.  Where a party is represented by a litigation representation (formerly known as “next friend”) or guardian in adoption (formerly known as “guardian ad litem”), sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) shall apply to the litigation representation or guardian in adoption as if he was a party to the proceedings, and the identification numbers of the party, the litigation representation and/or guardian in adoption must be stated after their names;
        2.  Where parties are involved in any proceedings as the personal representatives of the estate of a deceased person, sub-paragraphs (1) to (3) shall apply to the deceased person as if he were a party; and
        3.  Where more than one identification number applies to any party, person, entity or property, the identification numbers shall be stated in any convenient order.

_Identification numbers_

*   1.  When entering the identification number in the Electronic Filing Service, the full identification number, including the letters before and after the number should be entered. Descriptive text which is required to be entered into the actual document, such as “Japanese Identification Card No.”, should not be entered into the electronic form.

_Guidelines for the selection of identification numbers_

*   1.  The following guidelines should be followed in deciding on the appropriate identification number:
        1.  Natural person with Singapore identity card: For a natural person who is a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, the identification number shall be the number of the identity card issued under the National Registration Act (Cap. 201). The 7-digit number as well as the letters at the front and end should be stated. For example, “(NRIC No. S1234567A)”.
        2.  Natural person with Foreign Identification Number (FIN): For a natural person (whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not) who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act, but has been assigned a FIN under the Immigration Regulations (Cap. 133, Regulation 1), the identification number shall be the FIN. The number should be preceded by the prefix “FIN No.”.
        3.  Natural person – birth certificate or passport number: For a natural person (whether a Singapore citizen or permanent resident or not) who has not been issued with an identity card under the National Registration Act (Cap. 201) or assigned a FIN under the Immigration Regulations (Cap. 133, Regulation 1), the identification number shall be the birth certificate or passport number. The number should be preceded by either of the following, as appropriate: “(Issuing country) BC No.” or “(Issuing country) PP No.”.
        4.  Natural person – other numbers: For a natural person who is not a Singapore citizen or permanent resident, and has not been assigned a FIN under the Immigration Regulations (Cap. 133, Regulation 1) and does not have a birth certificate or passport number, the identification number shall be the number of any identification document he may possess. Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority issuing the identification document to be ascertained should be stated. For example, “Japanese Identification Card No.”.
        5.  Deceased person: For a deceased natural person, the identification number shall be as set out in sub-paragraph (7)(a) to (7)(d) above. However, if such numbers are not available, the identification number shall be the death registration number under the Registration of Births and Deaths Rules (Cap.267, Rule 1) or the equivalent foreign provisions, where the death is registered abroad. The number as well as the following words should be stated: “(Country or place of registration of death) Death Reg. No.”.
        6.  Company registered under the Companies Act: For a company registered under the Companies Act (Cap. 50), the identification number shall be the Unique Entity Number (UEN).
        7.  Company registered outside Singapore: For a company registered outside Singapore which is not registered under the Companies Act (Cap. 50), the identification number shall be the registration number of the company in the country of registration.
        8.  Business registered under the Business Registration Act: For a body registered under the Business Registration Act (Cap. 32), the identification number shall be the UEN number.
        9.  Limitation Liability Partnership registered under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act: For a limited liability partnership registered under the Limited Liability Partnerships Act 2005 (Cap. 163A), the identification number shall be the UEN number.
        10.  Other bodies and associations: For any other body or association, whether incorporated or otherwise, which does not fall within sub-paragraph (7)(f) to (7)(i) above, the identification number shall be any unique number assigned to the body or association by any authority. Both the number as well as some descriptive words which will enable the nature of the number given and the authority assigning the number to be ascertained should be stated. For example, “Singapore Trade Union Reg. No. 123 A”.
        11.  Ship or vessel: For a ship or vessel, the identification number shall be the registration number assigned by the port of registry. If no such registration number is available, the identification number assigned by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) or the number of the licence granted by any authority shall be the identification number.
        12.  No identification numbers exist: Where the appropriate identification numbers prescribed by sub-paragraphs (7)(a) to (7)(k) above do not exist, the following words should be stated immediately below or after the name of the party, person, entity or property concerned: “(No ID No. exists)”.

_Inability to furnish identification number at the time of filing a document_

*   1.  If a party who wishes to file a document is unable at the time of filing to furnish the necessary identification numbers required by this paragraph, the party may indicate “(ID Not Known)” at the time of filing. However, when the necessary identification numbers have been obtained, the party will have to furnish the necessary identification numbers to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions.

_Meaning of document_

*   1.  For the avoidance of doubt, the words “document” and “documents” when used in this paragraph include all originating processes filed in the Court.

_Non-compliance_

*   1.  Any document which does not comply with this paragraph may be rejected for filing by the SICC Registry.

## Endorsements on originating processes and other documents

*   1.  Where it is necessary to include endorsements on any document, the directions in this paragraph shall apply.
    2.  Endorsements are normally made on originating processes and other documents to show renewal, amendments and authorisation for service of the document in question. Such endorsements on originating processes and other documents do not require the Registrar’s signature as they are made pursuant to either an order of Court or the Rules of Court. The Registrar should therefore not be asked to sign such endorsements.
    3.  For documents that are filed through the Electronic Filing Service as electronic forms composed online:
        1.  Counsel should select the appropriate endorsement, and check the accuracy of the electronic form in the preview stage before filing the originating process or other document. The acceptance by the SICC Registry of electronic forms composed online does not affect the regularity or otherwise of any endorsements on the document.
        2.  Where endorsements can be made prior to the filing or issuance of a document, those endorsements shall be incorporated into the document before the document is filed or issued.
        3.  Where endorsements must be made on a document which has already been filed or issued, a fresh copy of the document containing the relevant endorsements shall be prepared, and the document must be re-filed or re-issued, as the case may be. An example of this would be renewals of writs of summons.

## Amendment of documents

*   1.  The directions in this paragraph shall apply to documents and pleadings filed in any proceedings in the Court.

_Amendment of any document_

*   1.  Where a document is required to be amended and filed in Court, a fresh copy of the document with the amendments included must be prepared, regardless of the number and length of the amendments sought to be made.
    2.  The procedure for amending a document is as follows:
        1.  a fresh amended copy of the document should be produced.
        2.  the number of times the document has been amended shall be indicated in parentheses after the name of the document. It should therefore be entitled “\[document name\] (Amendment No. 1)” or “\[document name\] (Amendment No. 2)” as appropriate.
        3.  the changes made in the document from the latest version of the document filed in Court should be indicated in the following way:
            1.  deletions shall be made by drawing a single line across the words to be deleted; and
            2.  insertions shall be underlined.
    3.  The directions in sub-paragraph (3)(b) shall not apply to originating summonses and summonses amended from an _inter partes_ application to an _ex parte_ application or vice versa.
    4.  The directions in sub-paragraph (3)(c) shall not apply to the originating processes, summonses and other electronic forms that are composed online through the Electronic Filing Service.
    5.  Where the amendments are so numerous or of such a nature or length that to make written alterations of the document would make it difficult or inconvenient to read, the amended document should comprise two versions:
        1.  a clean version without the amendments shown; followed in the same document by
        2.  a version showing the amendments in colour.

Where the document being amended is a writ, the amended writ must be reissued.

*   1.  A writ, pleading or other documents which has been amended must be endorsed with a statement that it has been amended, specifying the date on which it was amended and by whom the Order (if any) authorising the amendment was made and the date thereof, or, if no such order was made, the particular Rule in Order 20 of the Rules of Court pursuant to which the amendment was made.

_Amendment of pleadings_

*   1.  The directions in sub-paragraphs (2), (3) and (7) shall apply to the amendment of pleadings. A Statement of Claim which is amended for the first time should be filed as “Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1)” and a Defence that is amended for the second time should be filed as “Defence (Amendment No. 2)”.

_Colour schemes for amendments_

*   1.  The following colours shall be used to indicate the history of the amendments in the pleadings:
        1.  black for the first round of amendments;
        2.  red for the second round of amendments;
        3.  green for the third round of amendments;
        4.  blue for the fourth round of amendments; and
        5.  brown for subsequent rounds of amendments.

_Amendments for third time or more_

*   1.  From the third round of amendments onwards, the amended pleading should comprise two versions of the document:
        1.  a clean version without the amendments shown; followed in the same document by
        2.  a version showing the amendments in colour.

Only one amended pleading consisting of these two versions is required to be filed.

_Amendment endorsements on electronic forms_

*   1.  Order 20, Rule 10(2) of the Rules of Court requires that an amended pleading or other document be endorsed with a statement that it has been amended, specifying the date on which it was amended and by whom the order (if any) authorising the amendment was made and the date thereof, and if no such order was made, the number of the Rule in Order 20 pursuant to which the amendment was made. Where electronic forms are amended, the amendment endorsement shall take either one of the following forms:
        1.  by order of court made on \[date order was made\]; or
        2.  pursuant to Order 20, Rule \[cite specific rule number\].
    2.  The amendment endorsement shall be appended to the title of the electronic form, after the amendment number as required under sub-paragraph (3)(b) above. Where an electronic form is amended more than once, the endorsement need only cite the basis for the most recent amendment. For example,

“Originating Summons (Amendment No 3,

by order of court made on 1 January 2013)”

“Writ of Summons (Amendment No 1, pursuant to O 20, r 3)”

*   1.  The date of the electronic form shall reflect the date on which the document is amended.
