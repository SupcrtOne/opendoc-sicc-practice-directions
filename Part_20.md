    3.  Orders 42 and 43 of the Rules of Court should be read with the forms of judgment prescribed by Appendix A of the Rules of Court, and with Order 45 of the Rules of Court.

##  Draft orders

*   1.  Order 42, Rule 8(1) and (2) of the Rules of Court place the responsibility of approving the drafts of _inter partes_ judgments and orders on counsel. Counsel should therefore approve the drafts and not submit these drafts to the Registrar for approval.
    2.  The Registrar’s signature on a judgment or order is only for the purpose of validity and does not in any way affect the regularity or irregularity of the contents of any judgment or order.
    3.  Subject to sub-paragraph (4), parties in _inter partes_ applications should proceed to engross a final copy of the draft judgment for signature by the Registrar after agreeing on the draft. Draft orders of Court for _ex parte_ applications may be submitted with the summons and the supporting affidavit when these are filed.
    4.  For draft orders in electronic form that are composed online through the Electronic Filing Service, the process for extracting judgments and orders shall be as follows:
        1.  parties have the option of filing a system-generated order of court through the Electronic Filing Service.
        2.  before filing the system-generated order of court, the party extracting the order must:
            1.  review and edit the electronic form of the order of court to ensure that it accurately reflects the orders made by the Court; and
            2.  obtain the approval of all other parties to the application and provide evidence of such approval when filing the draft order of court, for example, a Portable Document Format (PDF) copy of a draft order of court signed by counsel of all parties to the application; and
        3.  where parties disagree over one or more terms of the order of court, the party filing the draft order of court shall be responsible for including in the electronic form of the order of court all versions of the disputed terms by editing the electronic form of the order of court. All relevant correspondence concerning the dispute must be provided when filing the draft order of court.
    5.  Order 42, Rule 8(3), (4) and (5) of the Rules of Court shall continue to apply:
        1.  in any case where the counsel concerned are unable to agree upon the draft, any one of them may seek clarification by way of a letter submitted in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions, of which notice shall be given to the other, to settle the terms of the judgment or order;
        2.  for judgments or orders composed online through the Electronic Filing Service, any counsel may similarly seek clarification by way of correspondence. That counsel shall be responsible for including in the electronic form of the draft judgment all versions of the disputed terms by editing the electronic form of the judgment or order.
    6.  An order of court containing terms which are (a) approved by both parties or (b) settled after submission to the SICC Registry will be sealed and engrossed.
    7.  Where the other party has no counsel or where an order is made on an _ex parte_ application, the draft shall be submitted to the Registrar. The draft which is approved by the Court shall be sealed and engrossed by the SICC Registry.

##  Judgment in default of appearance or service of defence

*   1.  The procedure for applying for judgment in default of appearance or service of defence will be by way of filing (in accordance with paragraph 44, 45 or 46 of these Practice Directions) a request to enter judgment in Form 79A together with the judgment in Form 79 of Appendix A to the Rules of Court. Counsel’s attention is drawn to Order 13, Rule 7(1) and Order 19, Rule 8A of the Rules of Court, which state:

“Judgment shall not be entered against a defendant under this Order unless a request to enter judgment in Form 79A is filed with the judgment in Form 79.”

*   1.  For requests to enter judgment through electronic forms composed online in the Electronic Filing Service, a signed hard copy of the request to enter judgment in the electronic form shall be retained by the counsel concerned and produced to the Court when required by the Court to do so.
    2.  In order to satisfy itself that a defendant is in default of appearance or service of defence, the Court may require an affidavit to be filed stating the time and manner service of the writ of summons was effected on the defendant, as well as the steps taken to ascertain that the defendant had failed to enter an appearance or serve a defence, as the case may be.
