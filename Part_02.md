**Time expires on a day other than a working day (O. 3, r. 3)**

3\. Where the time prescribed by these Rules, or by any judgment, order or direction, for doing any act expires on a day other than a working day, the act shall be in time if done on the next working day.

            2.  the interest that the applicant has in the matter; and
            3.  the reason for the search or inspection.

            1.  registered users can inspect the case file online through the Electronic Filing Service;
            2.  parties who are not registered users can inspect the case file by presenting a copy of the approval at the Service Bureau.

The Service Bureau may impose additional charges for downloading soft copies or printing hard copies of documents from the case file being inspected.
    2.  A case file which has been sealed, whether under Order 110, Rule 30 of the Rules of Court or otherwise, shall not be inspected by a non-party to those proceedings unless leave of Court is obtained pursuant to Order 110, Rule 30(10) and (11) of the Rules of Court.
    3.  Counsel must communicate to the Registrar in writing the names of persons authorised by them to make searches and inspections. Such authority may be in respect of a specific search or inspection or for a specified period.

All copies of documents taken in the course of inspection should not be used for purposes other than those stated in the request to inspect unless leave is obtained from the Court.
