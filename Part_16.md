# PART XVI - CONDUCT OF HEARINGS

## Conduct of Hearings

*   1.  Except as provided by sub-paragraph (2) or (5), all hearings of any cause or matter shall be conducted at the premises of the Court at the Supreme Court Building with the attendance of all parties or their counsel.
    2.  Hearings may be conducted through teleconference or video conference if directed by the Court hearing the matter. Each party shall make its own arrangements to procure the necessary telecommunications facilities or services in order to participate in the teleconference or video conference. Each party shall be responsible for ensuring that it joins the teleconference or video conference at the designated date and time. Costs reasonably incurred in participating in such teleconference or video conference may, subject to the discretion of the Court as to costs, be claimable as disbursements in the cause or matter.
    3.  Parties who wish to apply for the hearing to be conducted via teleconference or video conference shall submit a request to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. The request shall be submitted at least 7 working days before the date of the hearing, and only after seeking the consent of all the other parties to do so.
    4.  In the event that parties are unable to agree on the conduct of the hearing by teleconference or video conference, the requesting party shall seek directions from the Court by submitting the appropriate request in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. Such request shall be submitted at least 7 working days before the date of the hearing.
    5.  Where parties consent, the Court may determine any application or matter on the basis of the documents filed for that application or matter, and without the need for oral arguments or submissions by counsel pursuant to Order 110, Rule 51 of the Rules of Court.

## Requesting a hearing date

*   1.  When filing applications, counsel may make a request for a preferred hearing date.
    2.  Where possible, counsel should confer with counsel for all parties to the application before informing the SICC Registry of the preferred hearing date. Counsel arguing the application for all parties should be available to attend the hearing on the date(s) selected.

## Updating status of cause or matter

*   1.  Counsel should inform the SICC Registry when there are any developments which are likely to affect the length of the hearing of any application or of the trial, or any prospects of settlement.
    2.  In relation to trial, the attention of counsel is drawn to Order 34, Rule 5 of the Rules of Court, which provides:

“It shall be the duty of all parties to an action entered in any list to furnish without delay to the Registrar all available information as to the action being or being likely to be settled, or affecting the estimated length of the trial, and, _if the action is settled or withdrawn, to notify the Registrar of the fact without delay._” \[emphasis added\]

## Adjournment or vacation of trial dates and part-heard trials

*   1.  Where dates have been fixed for the trial of any cause or matter, any request for an adjournment or vacation of the trial dates shall be made to the Court by way of a formal application with a supporting affidavit, even in those cases where counsel for the other party or parties consent to the adjournment.
    2.  Such application should be filed, served, delivered or otherwise conveyed to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 44, 45 or 46 of these Practice Directions at least 14 calendar days before the trial. The supporting affidavit should state the reasons for the adjournment or vacation of trial date(s). Parties are reminded that even where the consent of the other parties to the adjournment or vacation of trial dates is obtained, the adjournment or vacation will not be granted as a matter of course. The Court will still consider the merits of the application before making its decision.
    3.  When a case is adjourned, the Judge shall, with the objective of completing the adjourned hearing as soon as possible, fix such days as are available for the hearing of the case after consulting with the parties or the Registrar may do so after consulting with the trial Judge and the parties.
    4.  In the event that the hearing of a case is not concluded within the number of days allotted, the trial Judge may, after consulting with the parties, direct the hearing of the case to continue beyond the allotted time, rather than adjourning the case part-heard to another date.

## Adjournment or vacation of hearings other than trials

*   1.  Before counsel makes a request to the Court for an adjournment or vacation of any hearings other than trials, they should seek the consent of the other party or parties to the matter. Unilateral requests made without first seeking the consent or views of the other party or parties to the matter will not be entertained, except in the most exceptional circumstances.
    2.  Subject to paragraph (2A) below, the request should be made to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. Such request should be made at least 14 calendar days before the hearing, setting out the reasons for the requested adjournment or vacation of hearing date(s).

(2A) Where an adjournment of any matter before the Court of Appeal is sought, the request should be made as soon as practicable after the hearing date is notified to the parties. Where there is a delay in the making of the request, the reason or reasons for the delay must be provided with the request. Any request for any adjournment on account of counsel’s diaries will not readily be acceded to.

*   1.  If the consent of all other parties to the matter is obtained, a letter stating that all parties have consented to the requested adjournment or vacation of hearings may be attached to the request referred to at sub-paragraph (2). Parties are reminded that even where the consent of the other parties to the adjournment or vacation of hearing dates is obtained, the adjournment or vacation will not be granted as a matter of course. The Court will still consider the merits of the request before making its decision.
    2.  If the consent of one or more of the other parties is not obtained, the letter should set out the reasons for the other parties’ objections, or explain why the consent of one or more of the other parties cannot be obtained. Any relevant correspondence between the parties should also be attached to the request referred to at sub-paragraph (2). The Court will then consider the contents of the request and the relevant correspondence before deciding whether the requested adjournment or vacation of hearing(s) should be allowed.
    3.  Notwithstanding sub-paragraphs (3) and (4), the Court may direct parties to attend before the Court to make an application for an adjournment instead of making a decision based on correspondence.

## Requests for further arguments before the Judge

*   1.  All requests for further arguments shall be made by way of a request filed through the Electronic Filing Service or otherwise submitted to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. The request shall:
        1.  state the party making the request;
        2.  identify the Judge who heard the matter in question;
        3.  specify when the order concerned was made;
        4.  state the provision of law under which the request is made;
        5.  set out the proposed further arguments briefly, together with any authorities; and
        6.  include a copy of each of the authorities cited.
    2.  A copy of the request should be furnished to all parties concerned.
