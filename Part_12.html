        </ol>

    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Conduct of Case Management Conferences by teleconference or video conference</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The Court may give directions for the conduct of Case Management Conferences via teleconference or video conference where the Court considers that it is appropriate to do so.</li>
      <li>Parties who wish to apply for the Case Management Conference to be conducted via teleconference or video conference shall submit a request to the SICC Registry in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. The request shall be submitted at least 7 working days before the date of the Case Management Conference, and only after seeking the consent of all the other parties to do so.</li>
      <li>In the event that parties are unable to agree on the conduct of Case Management Conferences by teleconference or video conference, the requesting party shall seek directions from the Judge by submitting the appropriate request in accordance with paragraph 11 of these Practice Directions. Such request shall be submitted at least 7 working days before the date of the Case Management Conference.</li>

        </ol>

</ul>

<p><em>Consideration of mediation or any other form of ADR at Case Management Conferences</em></p>

          <li>whether parties have interests that cannot be satisfied by court-ordered remedies such as the preservation of business reputation; and</li>
          <li>whether parties are in a subsisting commercial relationship and whether the preservation of that relationship is important.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Where parties are agreeable to mediation or any other form of ADR, the Judge may give directions for the subsequent conduct of the case, including the following:

      <li>With the consent of all parties, the Court may direct that one or more of the protocols set out at Appendix F of these Practice Directions, as amended by such order or direction as the Court may make, be adopted in the proceedings. These protocols relate to:</li>

<h2 id="case-management-bundle">Case Management Bundle</h2>

<ul>

        <ol>
          <li>pleadings;</li>
          <li>Case Memorandum;</li>
          <li>List of Issues; and</li>
          <li>Proposed Case Management Plan.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The plaintiff (or the party responsible for the preparation of the Case Management Bundle as directed by the Court at a Case Management Conference or otherwise) shall, in consultation with the other parties, be responsible for the preparation and upkeep of the Case Management Bundle.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="case-memorandum">Case Memorandum</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>The purpose of a Case Memorandum is to inform the Judge conducting the Case Management Conference of the general nature of the case and the issues which are expected to arise.</li>
      <li>The Case Memorandum shall contain:
        <ol>
          <li>a short and uncontroversial description of what the case is about; and</li>
          <li>a short and uncontroversial summary of the material procedural history of the case.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The Case Memorandum does not play any part in the trial. It is therefore unnecessary for parties to be unduly concerned about the precise terms in which it is drafted, provided it contains a reasonably fair and balanced description of the case.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Preparation of the Case Memorandum</em></p>

The Case Memorandum, together with comments of the other parties, shall be furnished to the SICC Registry in accordance with the timelines stipulated in paragraph 76(3) of these Practice Directions.</li>
      <li>Failure to agree to a Case Memorandum is a matter which the Court may take into account when dealing with costs of the Case Management Conference.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="list-of-issues">List of Issues</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Parties shall try to prepare an agreed List of Issues. If it is not possible, the plaintiff shall draft a List of Issues and send a copy to the other parties for comments.</li>
      <li>The agreed List of Issues (or the plaintiff’s list of issues with the other parties’ comments) is to be furnished to the SICC Registry in accordance with the timelines stipulated in paragraph 76(3) of these Practice Directions.</li>
      <li>The List of Issues should identify the principal issues in a structured manner. Parties are reminded to avoid long lists of detailed issues; sub-issues should only be identified where there is a specific purpose in doing so.</li>
      <li>The List of Issues:
        <ol>
          <li>is a document for use as a case management tool (e.g. to determine issues such as scope of documents to be produced, factual and expert evidence, and whether there are issues which may be summarily or preliminarily determined); and</li>
          <li>does not supersede the parties’ pleadings in the case. In the event of any conflict between the pleadings and the List of Issues, the pleadings shall prevail.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The Judge will, at his discretion, discuss with the parties and approve the List of Issues at the first or any subsequent Case Management Conference. Once the List of Issues has been approved by the Judge, the parties shall not amend or revise the List of Issues without the approval of the Judge.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="proposed-case-management-plan">Proposed Case Management Plan</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>All parties attending a Case Management Conference must be prepared to discuss the issues raised in the Proposed Case Management Plan. The Proposed Case Management Plan shall be in Form 10 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions.</li>
      <li>The purpose of the Proposed Case Management Plan is to facilitate the conduct of the proceedings by providing a framework to guide the discussion of various matters that may have to be dealt with prior to trial. The Judge may, after discussion with counsel, make such order or give such direction as the Judge thinks fit.</li>
      <li>The Judge may require parties to provide clarification in relation to the information set out in the Proposed Case Management Plan or any other additional information as the Judge deems fit. When so directed by the Court, the parties shall provide to the Court (and copied to all other parties) such information in accordance with the timelines stipulated in paragraph 76(3) above, or otherwise in accordance with any timelines that the Judge may direct.</li>
      <li>If parties have any specific or particular directions which they wish to seek from the Judge at a Case Management Conference, the parties shall indicate the orders sought in the Proposed Case Management Plan and provide the Court (and copied to all other parties) such proposed orders in accordance with the timelines stipulated in paragraph 76(3) of these Practice Directions.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="compliance-with-directions-made-at-case-management-conferences">Compliance with directions made at Case Management Conferences</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>It is the responsibility of the parties and their counsel to comply with any directions given by the Judge at a Case Management Conference. This includes complying with any directions or timelines set out in the Proposed Case Management Plan that has been approved by the Judge.</li>
      <li>In the event that parties are unable to comply with any directions or timelines, it is the duty of parties to inform the Court of the same as soon as practicable. Parties may request that a Case Management Conference be fixed for the purposes of obtaining further directions from the Judge in respect of the management of the cause or matter.</li>
      <li>The Registrar may, at any time, require an update on the progress of the cause or matter and give further directions as he deems fit. Unless otherwise directed by the Registrar, such updates and directions shall be by way of correspondence.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Failure to comply with case management directions</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Where a party fails to comply with any directions (including any timelines directed) by the Court, the other party may make an application to Court to:
        <ol>
          <li>direct the non-complying party to comply;</li>
          <li>impose costs or other sanctions for the non-compliance; and/or</li>
          <li>seek directions on the further conduct of the cause or matter.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The application referred to in sub-paragraph (4) should be brought without delay. However, prior to making the said application, the applying party should inform the non-complying party of its intention to do so.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Variation or amendment of case management directions</em></p>

<p>(5A) Where all parties to the proceedings agree, any party may apply for an order to vary or amend any direction or timeline. The application shall be made by way of a letter to the Registrar, stating the reason for the application and exhibiting a draft consent order signed by all parties or their counsel. The application shall be made as soon as practicable. The Court may:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ol>
          <li>make the order proposed by the parties;</li>
          <li>direct that the parties attend a further Case Management Conference; and/or</li>
          <li>give any other directions on the further conduct of the cause or matter.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Where non-compliance with directions may have an impact on trial dates</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Parties are reminded that once trial dates have been fixed, the postponement or vacation of such dates will be a measure of last resort. Where there has been any non-compliance with directions (including any directions on timelines) from the Court which may lead to a postponement or vacation of trial dates, the Court shall have the discretion to exercise its powers in a manner which will enable a cause or matter to proceed to trial within the period previously fixed, including but not limited to:
        <ol>
          <li>directing parties to comply with expedited or contracted timelines;</li>
          <li>directing trial to proceed on one or more issues which can be made ready for trial, and for remaining issues to be determined at a later tranche of the trial; and/or</li>
          <li>imposing costs or other sanctions for non-compliance with any directions given by the Court.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>Where the postponement or vacation of trial dates cannot be avoided, the Court may fix new trial dates at the earliest available dates and give expedited timelines to enable the cause or matter to proceed to trial.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="preparation-for-subsequent-case-management-conferences-if-any">Preparation for subsequent Case Management Conferences (if any)</h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Where necessary or appropriate, and whether on the request of parties or otherwise, the Judge may fix Case Management Conferences to monitor the progress of the cause or matter.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Updated Case Management Bundle</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>Where a Case Management Conference is fixed in accordance with sub-paragraph (1), and unless otherwise directed by the Judge, an updated Case Management Bundle shall be lodged with the SICC Registry at least 7 working days before any such Case Management Conference.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Responsibility for updating the Case Management Bundle</em></p>

<ul>
  <li>
