Pursuant to Order 110, Rule 7 of the Rules of Court, for the purposes of section 18D(1)(c) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322), the other conditions that an action (not being proceedings relating to international commercial arbitration that the Court has jurisdiction to hear under section 18D(2) of the Act) must satisfy are as follows:
        1.  the claims between the plaintiffs and the defendants named in the originating process when it was first filed are of an international and commercial nature;
        2.  each plaintiff and defendant named in the originating process when it was first filed has submitted to the Court’s jurisdiction under a written jurisdiction agreement; and
        3.  the parties do not seek any relief in the form of, or connected with, a prerogative order.
    2.  For the avoidance of doubt, the Court has the jurisdiction to hear and determine:

        2.  an originating summons under Order 52 of the Rules of Court for leave to commit a person for contempt in respect of any judgment or order made by the Court.
    3.  A plaintiff who desires to commence an action in the Court may proceed by way of a writ or by originating summons, as appropriate.
    4.  At the time of filing the writ or the originating summons, the plaintiff must also file a declaration in Form 8 of Appendix B of these Practice Directions. The declaration must be signed by the plaintiff or the plaintiff’s counsel and must:
        1.  explain why the action is of an international and commercial nature; and
        2.  exhibit a copy of the written jurisdiction agreement to which the plaintiff and defendant are party.

    7.  Pursuant to Order 110, Rule 57 of the Rules of Court, and for the purposes of section 18D(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322), the only condition that any proceedings relating to international commercial arbitration that are commenced by way of any originating process must satisfy is that those proceedings must be proceedings that the High Court may hear under the International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A).
    8.  For the purposes of determining whether any proceedings are “proceedings relating to international commercial arbitration” under section 18D(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322):
        1.  the arbitration is international only if it is international within the meaning of section 5(2) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A);
        2.  a court may consider the interpretation of commercial in the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration, as stated in note † in Article l(1) of that Model Law set out in the First Schedule to the International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A); and
        3.  a commercial arbitration —
            1.  includes, but is not limited to, an arbitration arising out of an investment, whether arising out of any contract, treaty, statute or other instrument; and
            2.  may include an arbitration between a State (or any constituent subdivision or agency of a State) and a national of another State.

## Challenges to the jurisdiction of the Court

Pursuant to Order 110, Rule 10 of the Rules of Court, the Court may consider whether it has jurisdiction or whether it should decline to assume jurisdiction either on its own motion, or on an application by a party.

## Transfer of proceedings to and from the Court

*   1.  Any party to proceedings in the High Court who desires to transfer the proceedings to the Court should make the application for the transfer to the High Court.
    2.  Likewise, any party to proceedings in the Court who desires to transfer the proceedings to the High Court should make the application for the transfer to the Court.
    3.  An application for a transfer of proceedings may only be made if all parties to the proceedings consent to the transfer. This does not apply where the High Court orders a transfer on its own motion.
    4.  An application for a transfer of proceedings shall be supported by an affidavit which must:
        1.  explain how the conditions for transfer under Order 110, Rules 12(3), (3B), (4) or 58 of the Rules of Court, as the case may be, are satisfied; and
        2.  exhibit the parties’ consent to the transfer.
    5.  All applications for transfer should be made promptly and should be brought:
        1.  where the proceedings are commenced by writ, within 28 days after the close of pleadings or after pleadings are deemed to be closed; or
        2.  where the proceedings are commenced by originating summons, within 28 days after the service of the originating summons on the defendant.
    6.  Pursuant to Order 110, Rules 12(3B), (4) and 58 of the Rules of Court, the High Court may, of its own motion, order proceedings in the High Court to be transferred to the Court. The High Court will hear submissions from the parties before making such an order.
    7.  Unless otherwise ordered by the High Court or Court (as the case may be), the parties in proceedings following an order for the transfer of proceedings shall pay the following fees:
        1.  for proceedings transferred from the High Court to the Court, the parties shall continue to pay the applicable fees which are payable in the High Court; and
        2.  for proceedings transferred from the Court to the High Court, the parties shall continue to pay the applicable fees which are payable in the Court.
    8.  A transfer order made pursuant to an application of the parties where all parties to the proceedings consent to the transfer is non-appealable.
    9.  An order made by the High Court or the Court refusing to transfer proceedings on the application of a party is appealable only with leave.
    10.  An order made by the High Court on its own motion to transfer proceedings from the High Court to the Court is appealable only with leave.

## Cessation of proceedings

*   1.  A party may discontinue proceedings or withdraw appearance in the Court in accordance with the procedure prescribed in Order 21 of the Rules of Court.
    2.  Pursuant to Order 110, Rule 10(3)(b) of the Rules of Court, where the Court decides that it has no jurisdiction or that it should decline to assume jurisdiction, the Court may dismiss or stay the proceedings, or make any other order it sees fit.
